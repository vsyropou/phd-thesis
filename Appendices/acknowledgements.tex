By means of the current thesis I pay tribute to my parents, the two people that always
supported me. Perhaps without even really realizing themselves, they provided the necessary conditions
for me to develop both an endless curiosity about everything around me, and a thirst for the truth,
which are essentially the reasons that I got involved in research. Regarding my nikhef colleagues,
Roel Aaij and Jeroen van Leerdam deserve a big and warm thank you. These people always found time to
supported me at the beginning of my PhD, answering all my questions and guiding me into programming in
a clean and readable way. Special thanks goes to Diego Martinez Santos the most clever, modest
and cool scientist I ever worked close with. Furthermore, another person that was always an endless
tank of knowledge at my disposal is my supervisor, Gerhard Raven. I thank him a lot for his patience
throughout my PhD as well as for his time that would always find for me to discuss with him.
I also thank my co-promotor, Patrick Koppenburg, for his detailed review of my thesis (and for
copng with my spelling mistakes). Special thanks also go to the stuff members of the nikhef
\lhcb group, and particularly to Marcel Merk, for providing a healthy, full of knowledge and of
course fun working environment. Lastly, I particularly thank my colleagues and friends Panagiwti
Tsopela and Jacco de Vries, who I both met at the beginning of my master in 2010. We have
faced the same difficulties and helped each other many times. But above all I thank them for
being kind and fun people, which are not so common features.
