Within the domain of modern physics there exists a field that attempts to answer a
fundamental question, that puzzled philosophers since the ancient times.
Namely, identify and understand the fundamental-indivisible building blocks that constitute the natural world.
Remarkably enough more that 2 millennia after Democritus, who introduced
the idea of atoms or \textgreek{άτομα} which in Greek means indivisible,
contemporary scientists still have not found a definite answer.
It seems that the observable universe consists of a handful of elementary particles and are
classified in two distinct categories: Namely {\it gauge bosons}, responsible for mediating all
the known particle interactions of nature (with the exception of gravity) and {\it fermions}
which are the constituents of matter. The recently discovered Higgs particle \cite{higgs-cms,higgs-atlas}
is a special type of boson that plays a central role in explaining how particles acquire mass.
Fermions can be divided further into {\it quarks}, which constitute particles like the proton and the neutron.
In general {\it Leptons} do not build stable atoms. However, electrons constitute the nucleus of atoms
and together with protons and neutrons do build atoms. Leptons, along with quarks, are present in crucial processes
like the formation and evolution of stars (which has direct impact on the way life evolved on earth).


\subsubsection{Particle Physics and The Standard Model}
The state of the art mathematical framework necessary to describe interactions between the
fermions is called \textit{Standard Model} \cite{sm-glashow,sm-weinberg,sm-salam}.
Describing a quantum mechanical process like particle interactions means being able
to compute the probability for a certain outcome in that particular particle interaction
and it involves non-trivial calculations. Thus the established predictive power of
the Standard Model is an important achievement. Furthermore, the recently
discovered Higgs boson \cite{higgs-cms,higgs-atlas}, which plays a special role in
the explanation of how particles acquire mass, makes Standard Model complete.

Despite its success, there are established phenomena and observations that the Standard
Model does not account for. Perhaps the most striking one is the absence of any description
of the most familiar, yet the weakest, interaction of nature, gravity. Or the
observed amount of matter-antimatter imbalance in the universe \cite{more-cpv-huet,more-cpv-gavela_I,more-cpv-gavela_II}
(Note that antimatter is a well understood state of matter that has its quantum numbers signs,
such as electric charge, flipped with respect to matter.) The above phenomena are a few
examples that reveal the incompleteness of the model. Thus the scientific method compels
to continued testing Standard Model predictions and look for ways to improve it.
Significant deviation from these predictions is a hint for the presence of {\it New Physics}
beyond the established model.

\subsubsection{\CP violation and New Physics}
According to the dominant theory, matter and antimatter were created in equal proportions
during the initial phase of the big bang \cite{more-cpv-huet,more-cpv-gavela_I,more-cpv-gavela_II}.
This idea invites the notion of a symmetry between matter and antimatter, known as Charge-Parity
or \CP symmetry. Perfect \CP symmetry implies that nature interacts with matter in the same
way as antimatter. However, at current time the observable universe
appears to be almost entirely populated by matter. Thus the origin of {\it \CP  violation}
follows as a natural question for which the Standard Model has to provide an explanation.

The established idea that nature indeed favors processes where the particles involved
are matter and not antimatter particles is captured by the Standard Model.
Despite this, it cannot account for the observed amount of matter-antimatter asymmetry \cite{more-cpv-huet,more-cpv-gavela_I,more-cpv-gavela_II}.
Hence, other sources of \CP violation beyond the Standard Model have to be active.
A typical place to search for hints of non Standard Model \CP violation is in parameters
of the model where its predicted value of \CP violation is very small. In that case any
significant observation of \CP violation is a direct hint for the presence of New Physics.
Collecting many such hints helps particle physicists to identify the weaknesses in the
Standard Model as well as choose between the various alternative models, such as {\it Supersymmetry}
 \eg \cite{Golfand:1971iw,Volkov:1973ix,Wess:1974tw}.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{The Weak Phase \phis}

An interesting parameter where the Standard Model prediction is nearly zero is the weak phase \phis.
This parameter manifests itself in $\bquark\to\cquark\cquarkbar\squark$ interactions, where a \bquark
quark decays into three other quarks. The most promising decay channel to measure \phis is the \BsJpsiPhi
decay, see \figref{app_jpsiphi_tree}. The Standard Model \phis prediction as well as its most
precise measurement by \lhcb is:

\begin{subequations}
  \label{app_phis_lhcb_theo}
  \begin{align}
  \centering
  \phiS{\lhcb}           &=  -0.010 \pm 0.039  \quad {\rm rad},
  \label{app_phis_lhcb}\\
  \phiS{SM,tree}  &= -0.03761 \; ^{+0.00073}_{-0.00082}  \quad {\rm rad}.
  \label{app_phis_theo}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\noindent Given the above measurement it follows that \phis is compatible
with the prediction and any New Physics effects that might appear in \phis must be small.
From an experimental point of view the situation is only now becoming interesting,
where the statistical uncertainty of the experimental measurement is approaching
the Standard Model prediction. Thus future \phis measurements define a high precision
era where the presence, or not, of New Physics will become apparent.

However, entering this promising era comes along with an important consideration
that has to be taken into account in order to make a robust claim about New Physics hints in \phis.
In particular there are certain processes within the Standard Model that \phis measurements
did not take into account so far. The magnitude of these processes, which originate from {\it penguin topologies}
and shown in \figref{app_jpsiphi_tree_peng}, are known to be small. Despite that, the
contribution of penguin topologies shift the Standard Model prediction,
$\phis^{\tiny \text{SM,tree}}$, by a small amount, $\Delta\phiS{peng}$. Considering
also that, as implied by \equref{app_phis_lhcb_theo}, potential New Physics
in \phis are also small; contributions to \phis from Standard Model penguin
topologies are crucial to disentangle from potential New Physics contributions, which also
shift the Standard Model prediction by $\Delta\phis^{\tiny \text{NP}}$.
The situation is depicted in following equation:

\begin{equation}
\centering
 \phis^{\text {eff}} = \phis^{\tiny \text{SM,tree}} + \Delta\phiS{peng} + \Delta\phis^{\tiny \text{NP}},
 \label{app_phis_sm_peng}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\phis^{\text {eff}}$ represents the \phis measurement.
Thus, in order to overcome the above mentioned limitations it becomes mandatory to estimate
contributions from penguin topology using different decay channels, also called control channels.
These control channels, \eg \BsJpsiKst, have identical tree and penguin topologies with \BsJpsiPhi
and by exploiting certain quark symmetries it is possible to properly estimate the size of
$\Delta\phis^{\tiny \text{NP}}$ and thus assess the presence of potential New Physics effects.

\subsubsection{Analyzing Particle Collisions}

Having introduced the parameter $\Delta\phiS{peng}$ and its role in the pursuit for New Physics
it is interesting to point out some aspects relevant to the experimental measurement of the previous parameter.
First and foremost by utilizing state of the art technologies scientists have built the most
powerful accelerator, \lhc, at \cern to improve and challenge the Standard Model. The machine is
capable of accelerating two beams of protons up to almost the speed of light and collide them at
a particular point in space called the interaction point, around which detectors are located.
To put these very energetic collisions into perspective; the energy density of a single proton-proton
collision at \lhc is approximately as high as when the universe was about a billionth of second old.
This effectively allows particle physicists to look back in time and probe information about the
state of matter, and antimatter, in the early universe.

The \lhcb experiment, located at \cern, is a dedicated experiment to the study of \CP violation.
The design of the detector, both at the hardware and software level, is optimized for detecting
special interactions of {\it heavy} quarks, like the \bquark and the \cquark quarks.
Emphasis is also given to the detection of muons, particularly to the ones that fly
inside a small cone along the beam direction. Note that muons can be found among the decay
products of many decay channels that \lhcb is interested in.

After recording particle collisions that are interesting for physics measurements, like $\Delta\phiS{peng}$,
the stored data are further processed such that the presence of noise is suppressed as much
as possible. In addition biases and finite resolution effects introduced by detector imperfections are
taken into account such that the physics model, which estimates the parameters of interest, is
corrected for these effects and thus provides valid and robust estimates when fitting the data.
The fitting process is based on the principle of {\it maximum likelihood}.
The likelihood is a function of the parameters of interest given the observed data.
At its maximum the likelihood function provides the {\it best fit} estimate for the parameters
of interest given the data that were used to build the previous likelihood function.

Visualizing the result of the fit to the \BsJpsiKst control channel involves plotting the fitted model on top of the data,
see \figref{app_angular_plot_thetas}. The data consist of three variables,
($\cos\thetaK$, $\cos\thetamu$, $\phihel$), which are related to the direction of the \BsJpsiKst decay particles.

\end{figure}

Having performed the likelihood fit to the data and
following the strategy indicated by \cite{Fleischer:1999zi,Faller:2008gt,DeBruyn:2014oga,DeBruyn-thesis}
the final result regarding penguin topology contributions to \phis is:

% \begin{equation}
% \label{app_delta_phis_result}
%   \DeltaPhisPeng{0}         = 0.00 ^{+0.57}_{-0.80}, \;\;
%   \DeltaPhisPeng{\parallel} = 0.06 ^{+0.69}_{-0.92}, \;\;
%   \DeltaPhisPeng{\perp}     = 0.17 ^{+0.69}_{-0.92},
% \end{equation}

\begin{align}
\label{app_delta_phis_result}
  \DeltaPhisPeng{0}         = 0.000 \; ^{+0.010}_{-0.014}, &\quad  \DeltaPhisPeng{\parallel} = 0.001 \; ^{+0.012}_{-0.016}, \nonumber \\
  \DeltaPhisPeng{\perp}     &= 0.003 \; ^{+0.012}_{-0.016}.
\end{align}

\noindent where quantities are expressed in rad (\phis is the argument of a complex number).
Note that the parameter $\Delta\phiS{peng}$ is split in its {\it polarization}
components. Essentially the \BsJpsiPhi decay probability, as well as the \phis value
are in principle different depending on the configuration of the particle spin
quantum numbers in the \BsJpsiPhi decay resulting in three polarization components
$\parallel,\perp {\rm and}\; 0$ respectively for parallel, perpendicular and longitudinal.
Thus, the penguin parameter $\Delta\phiS{peng}$ is expressed in a similar footing.


\subsubsection{Impact and Conclusions}

The shifts $\Delta\phiS{peng}$ quoted in \equref{app_delta_phis_result}
suggest that contributions of penguin topologies to the \BsJpsiPhi decay amplitude are indeed small,
$<0.017 \; {\rm rad}$ or $<1^\circ$ . Given the also small \phis measured value, shown in \equref{app_phis_lhcb},
it becomes mandatory to control penguin contributions in future \phis measurements.
Increasing the amount of data in the \lhc \runtwo might not be enough to yield
a significant claim on the presence of physics beyond the Standard Model and hence
the upgraded \lhcb detector becomes important in the pursuit for New Physics with
\phis in the future.
