Within the domain of modern physics there exists a particular field of research
that attempts to answer a fundamental question about the universe. This
question follows intuitively when observing the natural world and it troubled
philosophers since the ancient times. These philosophers attempted to understand
which are the fundamental blocks that build the world around them. Remarkably
enough after more that 2000 years since Democritus, the first person known that
introduced the idea of indivisible blocks of nature named atoms (or \textgreek{άτομα} in Greek),
contemporary scientists still have not found a definite answer yet. So far, it seems that the observable
universe consists of a handful of elementary particles, which are classified in two
distinct categories, namely {\it gauge bosons}, responsible for mediating all the
known fundamental forces of nature (with the exception of gravity) and {\it fermions}
which are the constituents of matter. There are 5 gauge bosons and 12 fermions.
Fermions can be divided further into {\it quarks}, which constitute composite
particles like the proton. A typical {\it lepton} is the electron which orbits
the nucleus of all atoms.

\subsubsection{Particle Physics and The Standard Model}
The state of the art mathematical framework necessary to describe interactions between the
fermions is called the \textit{Standard Model} of Particle Physics \cite{sm-glashow,sm-weinberg,sm-salam}.
Describing an interaction in this context means being able to predict the probability for a certain
outcome in a particle collision. Given the fact that energy and mass can convert
from one to the other, the type of the initial and final particles is not the same. For example,
two initial quarks can collide, or more precisely annihilate, and produce an electron-positron pair.
This is counter intuitive compared to the classical, non-quantum, description of particle collisions,
where the atomic structure of particles does not change. Thus, the established predictive power of
the Standard Model is an important achievement. Furthermore, the recently
discovered Higgs boson \cite{higgs-cms,higgs-atlas}, which plays a special role in explaining how
particles acquire mass, makes the Standard Model more robust.

Despite its success, there are certain established phenomena and observations that Standard
Model does not account for. Perhaps the most striking one is the absence of any description about the most familiar,
yet the weakest, force of nature, meaning gravity. Or perhaps the observed amount of matter-antimatter
asymmetry in the universe \cite{more-cpv-huet,more-cpv-gavela_I,more-cpv-gavela_II}.
Note that antimatter is a well understood state of matter that has its quantum numbers sign,
such as electric charge, flipped with respect to matter. The above phenomena are a few
examples that reveal the incompleteness of the model. Thus the scientific method compels
scientists to continue testing Standard Model predictions and look for ways to improve it.
Any significant deviation from these predictions could hint the presence of
{\it New Physics} beyond the established model.

\subsubsection{\CP Violation and New Physics}
According to the dominant consensus regarding the matter-antimatter balance in the
universe, it is believed that during the big bang matter and antimatter existed at
equal proportions. This idea invites the notion of the so called Charge-Parity (\CP)
symmetry between matter and antimatter. Perfect \CP symmetry imply that nature
interacts both with matter and antimatter at the same rate.
However, at current time the observable universe seems to be almost entirely populated by
matter. Thus the origin of \CP violation follows as a natural question for which the
Standard Model has to provide and explanation.

The established idea that nature favors processes where the final particles are matter
and not antimatter particles is indeed captured by the Standard Model. It addition, it
is interesting to point out that the origin of \CP violation is very closely related
to the mechanism that the fermions acquire mass, which is the Higgs boson. However,
despite the fact that the Standard Model allows for the presence of \CP violation,
it cannot account for the observed amount of matter-antimatter asymmetry.
Hence, other sources of \CP violation beyond the Standard Model have to be active.
The amount of \CP violation is typically quantified by several parameters.
The predicted by the Standard Model values of these parameters have to be compared
against the experimentally measured values to expose potential deviations and thus
reveal hints for the presence of New Physics {\color{red} rephrase this paragraph!!!}.

%  It is intreasting to point out that all these paramters have to yield
% a consistent picture with each other. This offers a powerful discrimination between alternative models that might
% modify Standard Model predictions. In other words these alternative models have to
% modify all the \CP violating parameters in a consistent way.


\subsubsection{The Weak Phase \phis}
% Violation of the \CP symmetry in particle physics typically manifests itself when comparing
% the rate, or probability, of two particle decay channels. The two channels are related by
% a \CP symmetry. In other words one decay consist of matter while the other of antimatter particles.
% Given the established presence of \CP violation in nature the previous rates are in principle not equal.

An interesting particle decay to measure \CP violation and compare it with the Standard Model
prediction is the \BsJpsiPhi decay.
% This particular decay is appealing since the prediction for the amount of \CP
% violation is very precise. In addition, the \BsJpsiPhi decay has a high signal purity as well
% as a high detection efficiency, making it appealing from an experimental point of view.
% Furthermore, the way \CP violation manifests itself in this particular decay is intriguing
% as both the \Bs particle and its antimatter counterpart, \Bsb, can decay to the same final state $f$,
% see \figref{app_interference}. This implies that according to quantum mechanics the two decay
% amplitudes can interfere with each other as shown in the following equation:
%
% \newcommand{\aOne}{\ensuremath{ \mathrm{A_1}}\xspace}
% \newcommand{\aTwo}{\ensuremath{ \mathrm{A_2}}\xspace}
% \begin{equation}
%   \centering
% A(\BsJpsiPhi)^2 = |\aOne + \aTwo|^2 = |\aOne|^2 + |\aTwo|^2 + \aOne\aTwo\cos(\phis + \delta),
%   \label{app_interf_amp}
% \end{equation}
%
% \noindent where the decay paths $\Bs\to f$ and $\Bs \to \Bsb \to f$ correspond to \aOne and \aTwo
% respectively. Note the \phis parameter appearing in the interference terms of the total amplitude.
% The other phase, $\delta$, is introduced by the strong interaction of quarks and it does not
% accountable for any \CP violating effect.
%
% \begin{figure}[h]
%   \centering
%   \resizebox{0.4\textwidth}{!}{\input{Figures/Chapter1/decay}}
%   \caption{The two interfering decay paths.}
%   \label{app_interference}
% \end{figure}

The parameter quantifying \CP violation in the \BsJpsiPhi decay is the so called weak phase \phis.
The Standard Model prediction of the latter parameter as well as its most precise measurement by
\lhcb is:

\begin{subequations}
  \label{app_phis_lhcb_theo}
  \begin{align}
  \centering
  \phiS{\lhcb}           &=  -0.010 \pm 0.039  \;\; \text{rad},
  \label{app_phis_lhcb}\\
  \phiS{SM,tree}  &= -0.03761 {}^{+0.00073}_{-0.00082}  \;\; \text{rad}.
  \label{app_phis_theo}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\noindent The goal of measuring \phis is to look for New Physics effects that Standard Model
does not predict. Given the measurement of \equref{app_phis_lhcb} it follows that \phis is compatible
with the prediction and any New Physics effects that might appear in \phis must be small.
From an experimental point of view the situation is just now becoming interesting
since the statistical uncertainty of the experimental measurement is approaching the Standard
Model prediction. Thus, the upgraded \lhcb detector takes \phis to a high precision era
of measurements.

However, entering this promising era comes along with an important consideration
that has to be taken into account in order to make a robust claim about the presence of New Physics
in \phis. In particular there are certain sub-leading effects within the Standard Model, coming from
the so called {\it penguin topologies} and shown in \figref{app_jpsiphi_tree_peng}, that the
\phis prediction does not take into account. These sub-leading effects shift
the Standard Model prediction, $\phis^{\tiny \text{SM,tree}}$, by a small amount, $\Delta\phiS{peng}$.
Considering also the fact that, as implied by \equref{app_phis_lhcb_theo}, potential New Physics in
\phis are small: One understands that contributions to \phis from Standard Model sub-leading penguin
topologies are impossible to disentangle from potential New Physics contributions, which also shift
the Standard Model prediction by, $\Delta\phis^{\tiny \text{NP}}$. The situation is depicted in
following equation:

\begin{equation}
\centering
 \phis^{\text {eff}} = \phis^{\tiny \text{SM,tree}} + \Delta\phiS{peng} + \Delta\phis^{\tiny \text{NP}}.
 \label{app_phis_sm_peng}
\end{equation}

% \noindent Note that increasing the precision of $\phis^{\text {eff}}$ does not help at all in distinguishing
% between $\Delta\phiS{peng}$ and $\Delta\phis^{\tiny \text{NP}}$. In addition, the subleading penguin
% topologies are suppressed with respect to tree in the \BsJpsiPhi decay by two orders of magnitude.
% This suppression factor is reflected to a large uncertainty in case penguin topology contributions
% are estimated using the \BsJpsiPhi decay channel. Thus, once again it is not possible to
% access $\Delta\phiS{peng}$ and make a robust claim about New Physics contributions to \phis.

  \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Leading order {\it tree} (left) and subleading penguin (right) \BsJpsiPhi decay topologies.}
  \label{app_jpsiphi_tree_peng}
\end{figure}

In order to overcome the above mentioned limitations it becomes mandatory to estimate
contributions from penguin topology using different decay channels, also called control channels.
These control decay channels have identical tree and penguin topologies with \BsJpsiPhi.
Exploiting certain quark symmetries it is possibe to properly estimate the size of
$\Delta\phis^{\tiny \text{NP}}$ and thus assess the presence of potential New Physics effects.


% The only difference is that one of the quarks forming the \Pphi
% particle in \figref{app_jpsiphi_tree_peng} is replaced with another quark to form the \Kstarz
% and \rhoz particles respectively for the \BsJpsiKst and \BdJpsiRho decays.
% This difference in
% quarks between the \BsJpsiPhi decay and the control channels introduces uncertainty to
% $\Delta\phiS{peng}$, since the impact of assuming perfect symmetry between quarks has to be
% estimated and propagated as a systematic uncertainty. However, the penguin topology in both of
% the control channels is not suppressed with respect to the tree and thus the uncertainty to
% $\Delta\phiS{peng}$ does not suffer from any suppression when measured using these control
% channels. Finally, the overall uncertainty of $\Delta\phiS{peng}$ is such
% that by using both control channels it is indeed possible to properly estimate the size of
% $\Delta\phis^{\tiny \text{NP}}$ and thus assess the presence of potential New Physics effects.

\subsubsection{The \lhcb Detector}
Utilizing state of the art technologies physicists have built the most powerful accelerator, \lhc, at \cern
to test Standard Model predictions like \phis. The machine is capable of accelerating protons
up to almost the speed of light and collide them at a very a high energy. To put this into perspective
the energy density of a single proton-proton collision at \lhc is approximately as high as when the
universe was $10^{-10} \sec$ old. This effectively allows particle physicists to look back in time and
probe information about the state of matter, and antimatter, in the early universe.
The \lhcb experiment, located at \cern, is a dedicated experiment. The design of the detector,
both at the hardware and software level, is optimized for detecting interactions of the so called
{\it heavy} quarks, like the \bquark and the \cquark quarks.

% It is interesting to point out two specific
% novel features of the detector. The first one involves the excellent spacial resolution of particle
% trajectories which is due to the fact that \lhcb places its first active detector element closer
% to the \lhc beam pipe than any other detector. Note that high spacial resolution directly increases
% the sensitivity to most of the measurements that \lhcb targets. The second novel technique is the
% {\it Online Detector Alignment and Calibration} endeavor which essentially enables the output data
% quality of the trigger system to be as high as possible, eliminating the need of intermediate storing
% and processing triggered data until a proper detector calibration becomes available.
% This saves valuable time and resources and at the same time allows to increase the output data bandwidth,
% which will eventually reduce the statistical uncertainty in all \lhcb measurements.

% Another more specific improvement involves the detection of muons. The latter is a heavier version of
% the electron and they are produced quite often in particle collisions. Muons are important for the \lhcb
% experiment and are easy to identify since they penetrate matter deeply. Given that a large fraction of
% the \lhcb physics program is based on the identification of muons in the final state: for example the
% measurement of \phis through \BsJpsiPhi decays. It is therefore of major importance to maintain and
% improve the efficiency and purity of identified muons. In addition, newly introduced decay channels
% to the \lhcb physics program involve muons with low, $<0.5 \gevc$, transverse momentum (\pt), see
% \cite{LHCB-CONF-2016-013-001} and \cite{LHCb-CONF-2016-012}. Note that these decay channels are
% promising probes for New Physics and \lhcb has the potential to profit from lowering the \pt threshold.

%
% A dedicated study to explore the possibilities of detecting and recording low transverse momentum
% muons. The study essentially showed that by exploiting the newly introduced charge information of
% muons early in the trigger sequence, it is indeed possible to push the transverse momentum
% threshold lower. The results are summarized in \figref{app_eff_comp}, where the efficiency
% a distinguishing a muon from random detector noise is plotted against its transverse momentum,
% both for the default and the upgraded muon matching algorithm. Note that the performance in
% terms of time between the two algorithms is the same.

\subsubsection{Analyzing Particle Collisions}
Having introduced the parameter $\Delta\phiS{peng}$ and its role in the pursuit of New Physics
it is interesting to point out some aspects relevant to the experimental measurement of the previous parameter.

To begin with the recorded necessary to extract $\Delta\phiS{peng}$ have to be processed such that
the presence of background processes, noise, is suppressed as much as possible.
% Background processes are in general introduced due to detector imperfections and finite experimental
% resolution.

%  Obtaining a pure sample of specific particle collisions is not always a straight forward
% task and as in the case of the \BsJpsiKst decay it required the implementation of several techniques to
% prepare the data sample for fitting.
%
% Furthermore, the spin configurations of the particles involved in the \BsJpsiPhi decay, where
% \Jpsimumu and \phiKK, is such that the direction in space of the final state particles, \mumu
% and $\Kp\Km$, becomes relevant and have to be accounted by a multi dimensional model, which further
% complicates the analysis. Similar treatment has to be applied in the analysis of the control
% channel decays as well.
%
% At that point it is useful to emphasize the fact that , parameters of interest
% require a sufficiently large number of recorded particle collisions, data, in order to be estimated.
% This welcomes a statistical approach, where the larger the data size is the more precise the estimate
% on the parameter of interest becomes. Furthermore, finite experimental resolution as well as
% various the detector response introduce biases that have to be taken into account by the previous
% multi dimensional model.

           Various components of the model relevant to its \CP structure are shown with colored lines.}
  \label{app_angular_plot_thetas}
\end{figure}

Once the data have been cleaned from the presence of background and all the experimental effects are
properly taken into account a physics model is fitted to the data, in order to estimate the parameters of interest.
The fitting process is based on the principle of maximum likelihood. The likelihood is a
function of the parameters of interest given the observed data. At its maximum the likelihood function
provides the so called {\it best fit} estimate for the parameters of interest given the data that was
used to build the previous likelihood function. Visualizing the result of fitting the data involves
plotting the fitted model on top of the data, see \figref{app_angular_plot_thetas}. The data in the
latter figure consist of three variables ($\cos\thetaK$,$\cos\thetamu$,$\phihel$) releated to the
direction in space of the final state particles ({\color{red} clarify!!}).


\subsubsection{Result, Impact and Conclusion}

Having performed the likelihood fit of the multidimensional model to the data and
following the strategy indicated by \cite{Fleischer:1999zi,Faller:2008gt,DeBruyn:2014oga,DeBruyn-thesis}
the final result regarding penguin topology contributions to phis is shown in the following equation:

\begin{equation}
\label{app_delta_phis_result}
  \DeltaPhisPeng{0}         = 0.00 ^{+0.57}_{-0.80}, \;\;
  \DeltaPhisPeng{\parallel} = 0.06 ^{+0.69}_{-0.92}, \;\;
  \DeltaPhisPeng{\perp}     = 0.17 ^{+0.69}_{-0.92},
\end{equation}


\noindent where the used units are degrees. Note that the parameter $\Delta\phiS{peng}$ is split in the so called {\it polarization}
components. Essentially the total \BsJpsiPhi amplitude, or probability, as well as the \phis value
are in principle different depending on the configuration of the particle spins in the \BsJpsiPhi
decay resulting in the three amplitude components $\parallel,\perp,0$. Thus, the penguin parameter
$\Delta\phiS{peng}$ has to be estimated in a similar footing.

The shifts $\Delta\phiS{peng}$ quoted in \equref{app_delta_phis_result}
suggest that contributions of penguin topologies to the \BsJpsiPhi decay amplitude are
small, $<1^\circ$. Given the also small \phis measured value from \lhcb shown in \equref{app_phis_lhcb}
it becomes mandatory to control penguin contributions in future \phis measurements.
Furthermore, the sensitivity from the experimental side is interesting with respect to
the Standard Model prediction, see \equref{app_phis_lhcb_theo}. Thus, potential deviations from this
prediction is going to play a central role in future and more precise \phis measurements.
Increasing the amount of data in the \lhc \runtwo might not be enough to yield
a significant claim on the presence of physics beyond the Standard Model and hence
the upgraded \lhcb detector becomes important in the pursuit for New Physics with \phis in the future.
