Within the domain of modern physics there exists a particular field of research
that attempts to answer a fundamental question about the universe. This
question follows intuitively when observing the natural world and it troubled
philosophers since the ancient times. These philosophers attempted to identify
and understand the fundamental blocks that build the world around them.
Remarkably enough after more that 2000 years since Democritus, whoc first
introduced the idea of indivisible blocks of nature named atoms (or \textgreek{άτομα} in Greek),
contemporary scientists still have not found a definite answer yet.
It seems that the observable universe consists of a handful of elementary particles,
which are classified in two distinct categories, namely {\it gauge bosons},
responsible for mediating all the known fundamental forces of nature (with the
exception of gravity) and {\it fermions} which are the constituents of matter.
There are five gauge bosons and twelve fermions. Fermions can be divided further into
{\it quarks}, which constitute particles like the proton, while {\it leptons}
are particles like the electron.

\subsubsection{Particle Physics and The Standard Model}
The state of the art mathematical framework necessary to describe interactions between the
fermions is called \textit{Standard Model} \cite{sm-glashow,sm-weinberg,sm-salam}.
Describing a quantum mechanical process like a particle interaction means being able
to compute the probability for a certain outcome in that partticular particle collision
and it involves highly non-trivial calculations. Thus the established predictive power of
the Standard Model is an important achievement. Furthermore, the recently
discovered Higgs boson \cite{higgs-cms,higgs-atlas}, which plays a special role in
explaining how particles acquire mass, makes the Standard Model more robust.

Despite its success, there are certain established phenomena and observations that Standard
Model does not account for. Perhaps the most striking one is the absence of any description
about the most familiar, yet the weakest, force of nature, meaning gravity. Or perhaps the
observed amount of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe \cite{more-cpv-huet,more-cpv-gavela_I,more-cpv-gavela_II}.
Note that antimatter is a well understood state of matter that has its quantum numbers sign,
such as electric charge, flipped with respect to matter. The above phenomena are a few
examples that reveal the incompleteness of the model. Thus the scientific method compels
scientists to continue testing Standard Model predictions and look for ways to improve it.
Any significant deviation from these predictions could hint the presence of {\it New Physics}
beyond the established model.

\subsubsection{\CP violation and New Physics}
According to the dominant consensus regarding the matter-antimatter balance in the
universe, it is believed that at the point in time where the big bang took place
matter and antimatter existed at equal proportions. This idea invites the notion of a symmetry between matter and
antimatter, also known as Charge-Parity or \CP symmetery. Perfect \CP symmetry
implyes that nature interacts with matter as frequently as with antimatter.
However, at current time the observable universe seems to be almost entirely
populated by matter. Thus the origin of {\it \CP  violation} follows
as a natural question for which the Standard Model has to provide an explanation.

The established idea that nature indeed favors processes where the particles involved
are matter and not antimatter particles is captured by the Standard Model.
Despite that it cannot account for the observed amount of matter-antimatter asymmetry.
Hence, other sources of \CP violation beyond the Standard Model have to be active.
A typical place to search for hints of non Standard Model \CP violation is in parameters
of the model where its prediction is very small. In that case any significant observation
of large \CP violation in a certain parameter is a direct hint for the presence of New Physics.

\subsubsection{The Weak Phase \phis}

An interesting parameter where the Standard Model prediction is nearly zero is the weak pahse \phis.
This parameter manifests itsef in particle decays where a \bquark decays into three other quarks namely \cquark\cquarkbar\squark.
The most promising decay channell where the previous feaure takes place is the \BsJpsiPhi decay, see \figref{app_jpsiphi_tree}.
The Standard Model \phis prediction as well as its most precise measurement by \lhcb is:

\begin{subequations}
  \label{app_phis_lhcb_theo}
  \begin{align}
  \centering
  \phiS{\lhcb}           &=  -0.010 \pm 0.039  \;\; \text{rad},
  \label{app_phis_lhcb}\\
  \phiS{SM,tree}  &= -0.03761 {}^{+0.00073}_{-0.00082}  \;\; \text{rad}.
  \label{app_phis_theo}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\noindent Given the above measurement it follows that \phis is compatible
with the prediction and any New Physics effects that might appear in \phis must be small.
From an experimental point of view the situation is just now becoming interesting
since the statistical uncertainty of the experimental measurement is approaching the Standard
Model prediction. Thus future \phis measurements define a high precision era
necessary to continue looking for hints of New Physics.

However, entering this promising era comes along with an important consideration
that has to be taken into account in order to make a robust claim about the presence of New Physics
in \phis. In particular there are certain sub-leading effects within the Standard Model, coming from
{\it penguin topologies} and shown in \figref{app_jpsiphi_tree_peng}, that the
\phis measurement does not take into account. These sub-leading effects essentially shift
the Standard Model prediction, $\phis^{\tiny \text{SM,tree}}$, by a small amount, $\Delta\phiS{peng}$.
Considering also the fact that, as implied by \equref{app_phis_lhcb_theo}, potential New Physics in
\phis are small: One understands that contributions to \phis from Standard Model sub-leading penguin
topologies are impossible to disentangle from potential New Physics contributions, which also shift
the Standard Model prediction by, $\Delta\phis^{\tiny \text{NP}}$. The situation is depicted in
following equation:

\begin{equation}
\centering
 \phis^{\text {eff}} = \phis^{\tiny \text{SM,tree}} + \Delta\phiS{peng} + \Delta\phis^{\tiny \text{NP}}.
 \label{app_phis_sm_peng}
\end{equation}

In order to overcome the above mentioned limitations it becomes mandatory to estimate
contributions from penguin topology using different decay channels, also called control channels.
These control decay channels have identical tree and penguin topologies with \BsJpsiPhi, where
by exploiting certain quark symmetries it is possibe to properly estimate the size of
$\Delta\phis^{\tiny \text{NP}}$ and thus assess the presence of potential New Physics effects.

\subsubsection{Analyzing Particle Collisions}
Having introduced the parameter $\Delta\phiS{peng}$ and its role in the pursuit of New Physics
it is interesting to point out some aspects relevant to the experimental measurement of the previous parameter.
First and and foremost by utilizing state of the art technologies physicists have built the most
powerful accelerator, \lhc, at \cern to test Standard Model predictions like \phis. The machine is
capable of accelerating protons up to almost the speed of light and collide them at a very a high energy.
To put this into perspective the energy density of a single proton-proton collision at \lhc is approximately
as high as when the universe was $~1 n\sec$ old. This effectively allows particle physicists to look
back in time and probe information about the state of matter, and antimatter, in the early universe.
The \lhcb experiment, located at \cern, is a dedicated to the study of \CP violation experiment.
The design of the detector, both at the hardware and software level, is optimized for detecting
interactions of the so called {\it heavy} quarks, like the \bquark and the \cquark quarks.
Special emphasis is also given to the detection of muons, particularly the ones with low
transverse momentum. Note that muons are leptons (defined earlier) which exist in the final decay products
of most of the decay channnels that \lhcb is intreated in.

After recording parcicle collions that are intreasting for physics measurements, like $\Delta\phiS{peng}$,
the stored data are further processed such that the presence of noise, or background, is suppressed as much
as possible. In addition biases and limited resolution effects introduced by the detector are correctd and
implemented in the physics model that is fitted to the data, in order to estimate the parameters of interest.
The fitting process is based on the principle of maximum likelihood. The likelihood is a
function of the parameters of interest given the observed data. At its maximum the likelihood function
provides the so called {\it best fit} estimate for the parameters of interest given the data that were
used to build the previous likelihood function. Visualizing the result of the fit involves
plotting the fitted model on top of the data, see \figref{app_angular_plot_thetas}.
The data in that case consist of three variables, ($\cos\thetaK, \cos\thetamu, \phihel$), which are
releated to the direction, in 3D space, of the \BsJpsiPhi final decay particles.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Result, Impact and Conclusion}

Having performed the likelihood fit to the data and
following the strategy indicated by \cite{Fleischer:1999zi,Faller:2008gt,DeBruyn:2014oga,DeBruyn-thesis}
the final result regarding penguin topology contributions to \phis is shown in the following equation:

\begin{equation}
\label{app_delta_phis_result}
  \DeltaPhisPeng{0}         = 0.00 ^{+0.57}_{-0.80}, \;\;
  \DeltaPhisPeng{\parallel} = 0.06 ^{+0.69}_{-0.92}, \;\;
  \DeltaPhisPeng{\perp}     = 0.17 ^{+0.69}_{-0.92},
\end{equation}


\noindent where quantities are expresed in degrees. Note that the parameter $\Delta\phiS{peng}$ is split in its {\it polarization}
components. Essentially the \BsJpsiPhi decay probability, as well as the \phis value
are in principle different depending on the configuration of the particle spins in the \BsJpsiPhi
decay resulting in the three polarization components $\parallel,\perp,0$. Thus, the penguin parameter
$\Delta\phiS{peng}$ is expressed in a similar footing.

The shifts $\Delta\phiS{peng}$ quoted in \equref{app_delta_phis_result}
suggest that contributions of penguin topologies to the \BsJpsiPhi decay amplitude are
small, $<1^\circ$. Given the also small \phis measured value from \lhcb shown in \equref{app_phis_lhcb}
it becomes mandatory to control penguin contributions in future \phis measurements.
Furthermore, the sensitivity from the experimental side is interesting with respect to
the Standard Model prediction, see \equref{app_phis_lhcb_theo}. Thus, potential deviations from this
prediction is going to play a central role in future and more precise \phis measurements.
Increasing the amount of data in the \lhc \runtwo might not be enough to yield
a significant claim on the presence of physics beyond the Standard Model and hence
the upgraded \lhcb detector becomes important in the pursuit for New Physics with \phis in the future.
