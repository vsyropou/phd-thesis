\vspace*{0.05\textwidth}

Within the domain of modern pysics there exists a particular field of research
that attempts to answer a fundamental question about the natural world. This
question follows intuitivelly when observing the natural world and it troubled
philospphers since the ancient times. These philosophers attempted to explain
what are the indivisible blocks that build the world around them. Remarkably
enough after more that 2000 years since Democitus, who is commonly accepted as
the first person that introduced the idea of idivisible blocks of nature named
atoms (or \textgreek{άτομα} in Greek), contemprary scientists still have not found a definite
answer on the fundamental blocks of nature. So far, it seems that the observable
universe consists of a handful of elementary particles, which are clasified in two
distinct categories, namely {\it gauge bosons}, responsible for mediating all the
known fundamental forces of nature (with the exception of gravity) and {\it fermions}
which are the constituents of matter. There are 5 gauge bosons and 12 fermions.
Fermions can be divided further into {\it quarks}, which constitute composite
particles like the proton. A typical {\it lepton} is the elctron which orbits
the nucleus of all atoms.

\subsubsection{Particle Physics and Standard Model}
The state of the art mathematical framework necessary to describe the interactions between the
fermions is called the \textit{Standard Model} of Particle Physics \cite{sm-glashow,sm-weinberg,sm-salam}.
Describing an interaction in this context means being able to predict the outcome
of (fundamental) particle colisions. Given the fact that energy and mass can convert
from one to the other, predicting an outcome of fundamental paritcle colisions is no
trivial task. The recently discovered Higgs boson \cite{higgs-cms,higgs-atlas}
plays a special role in explaining how particles acquire mass. In addion the the higgs
particle makes the Standard Model robust.

Despite beign robust,. .. blah
\begin{itemize}
\item New physics
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{\CP Violation and the Weak Phase \phis}

\begin{itemize}
\item Matter and antimatter in the uni
\item Non SM cp violation and probe NP
\item Status and high precision era, (how phis delta gammas contour)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The \lhcb Detector}

\begin{itemize}
\item \lhc cern most powerfull accelrator
\item \lhcb dedicated bfys experiment, unique capabilities, high signal purity. maybe mention proximity to beam and pid.
\item future increase of low pt muon efficiency extents NP reach.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Analysing Particle Collisions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Non infinite resolution and experimental effects and background forces statistical approach.
\item The \BsJpsiKst decay as a probe for penguins
\item Angular analysis of the decay products to probe polarization fractions. The amplitude has many
      components depending on the oriantation of the spin vectors.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Impact and conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Accordin to Robert recepie Delta phis is found to be blah.
\item This is summarised in the picture blah.
\item It is intreasting becaus blahhhh...
\end{itemize}
