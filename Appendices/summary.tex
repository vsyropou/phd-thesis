Within the domain of modern physics there exists a particular field
that attempts to answer {\it the} fundamental question, which follows
naturally when observing the cosmos and it troubled
philosophers since the ancient times. These philosophers attempted to
identify and understand the fundamental-idivisible building blocks that constitute the natural world
around them. Remarkably enough more that 2 milenia after Democritus, who introduced
the idea of atoms or \textgreek{άτομα} which in Greek means indivisible,
contemporary scientists still have not found a definite answer.
It seems that the observable universe consists of a handful of fundamental particles
called {\it elementary} particles and are classified in two distinct categories:
Namely {\it gauge bosons}, responsible for mediating all the known particle interactions of
nature (with the exception of gravity) and {\it fermions} which are the constituents of
matter. There are five gauge bosons and twelve fermions. Fermions can be divided further
into {\it quarks}, which constitute particles like the proton and the neutron. {\it Leptons}
on the other hand do not build stable atoms, with the exception of electrons which together with
protons and neutrons build atoms. Instead leptons are present in a series of crucial processes
like the formaltion and evolution of stars or to the way life evolved on earth.


\subsubsection{Particle Physics and The Standard Model}
The state of the art mathematical framework necessary to describe interactions between the
fermions is called \textit{Standard Model} \cite{sm-glashow,sm-weinberg,sm-salam}.
Describing a quantum mechanical process like a particle interaction means being able
to compute the probability for a certain outcome in that partticular particle interaction
and it involves highly non-trivial calculations. Thus the established predictive power of
the Standard Model is an important achievement. Furthermore, the recently
discovered Higgs boson \cite{higgs-cms,higgs-atlas}, which plays a special role in
explaining how particles acquire mass, makes the Standard Model more robust.

Despite its success, there are certain established phenomena and observations that Standard
Model does not account for. Perhaps the most striking one is the absence of any description
about the most familiar, yet the weakest, force of nature, meaning gravity. Or perhaps the
observed amount of matter-antimatter balance in the universe \cite{more-cpv-huet,more-cpv-gavela_I,more-cpv-gavela_II}
(Note that antimatter is a well understood state of matter that has its quantum numbers sign,
such as electric charge, flipped with respect to matter.) The above phenomena are a few
examples that reveal the incompleteness of the model. Thus the scientific method compels
scientists to continue testing Standard Model predictions and look for ways to improve it.
Significant deviation from these predictions hint the presence of {\it New Physics}
beyond the established model.

\subsubsection{\CP violation and New Physics}
According to the dominant theory matter and antimatter were created at equal proportions
when the big bang took place. This idea invites the notion of a
symmetry at the fundamental particle level between matter and antimatter, also known as
Charge-Parity or \CP symmetery. Perfect \CP symmetry implyes that nature interacts with
matter as frequently as with antimatter. However, at current time the observable universe
appears to be almost entirely populated by matter. Thus the origin of {\it \CP  violation}
follows as a natural question for which the Standard Model has to provide an explanation.

The established idea that nature indeed favors processes where the particles involved
are matter and not antimatter particles is captured by the Standard Model.
Despite that it cannot account for the observed amount of matter-antimatter asymmetry.
Hence, other sources of \CP violation beyond the Standard Model have to be active.
A typical place to search for hints of non Standard Model \CP violation is in parameters
of the model where its prediction is very small. In that case any significant observation
of large \CP violation in a certain parameter is a direct hint for the presence of New Physics.
Collecting many such hints helps particle physicists to identify the weekneses in the
Standard Model as well as choose between the plethora of alternative-complementary models.

\subsubsection{The Weak Phase \phis}

An interesting parameter where the Standard Model prediction is nearly zero is the weak pahse \phis.
This parameter manifests itsef in $\bquark\to\cquark\cquarkbar\squark$ interactions, where a \bquark
quark decays into three other quarks. The most promising decay channell where the previous feaure
takes place is the \BsJpsiPhi decay, see \figref{app_jpsiphi_tree}. The Standard Model \phis
prediction as well as its most precise measurement by \lhcb is:

\begin{subequations}
  \label{app_phis_lhcb_theo}
  \begin{align}
  \centering
  \phiS{\lhcb}           &=  -0.010 \pm 0.039  \;\; \text{rad},
  \label{app_phis_lhcb}\\
  \phiS{SM,tree}  &= -0.03761 {}^{+0.00073}_{-0.00082}  \;\; \text{rad}.
  \label{app_phis_theo}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\noindent Given the above measurement it follows that \phis is compatible
with the prediction and any New Physics effects that might appear in \phis must be small.
From an experimental point of view the situation is just now becoming interesting.
Meaning that the statistical uncertainty of the experimental measurement is approaching
the Standard Model prediction. Thus future \phis measurements define a high precision
era where the presence, or not, of New Physics will become apparent.

However, entering this promising era comes along with an important consideration
that has to be taken into account in order to make a robust claim about New Physics hints in \phis.
In particular there are certain processes within the Standard Model that \phis measurements
did not take into account so far. The magnitude of these processes, which originate from {\it penguin topologies}
and shown in \figref{app_jpsiphi_tree_peng}, are known to be small. Despite that, the
contribution of penguin topologies essentially shift the Standard Model prediction,
$\phis^{\tiny \text{SM,tree}}$, by a small amount, $\Delta\phiS{peng}$. Considering
also the fact that, as implied by \equref{app_phis_lhcb_theo}, potential New Physics
in \phis are also small: One understands that contributions to \phis from Standard Model penguin
topologies are impossible to disentangle from potential New Physics contributions, which also
shift the Standard Model prediction by $\Delta\phis^{\tiny \text{NP}}$.
The situation is depicted in following equation:

\begin{equation}
\centering
 \phis^{\text {eff}} = \phis^{\tiny \text{SM,tree}} + \Delta\phiS{peng} + \Delta\phis^{\tiny \text{NP}},
 \label{app_phis_sm_peng}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\phis^{\text {eff}}$ represents the \phis measuremnet.
Thus, in order to overcome the above mentioned limitations it becomes mandatory to estimate
contributions from penguin topology using different decay channels, also called control channels.
These control decay channels have identical tree and penguin topologies with \BsJpsiPhi, where
by exploiting certain quark symmetries it is possibe to properly estimate the size of
$\Delta\phis^{\tiny \text{NP}}$ and thus assess the presence of potential New Physics effects.

\subsubsection{Analyzing Particle Collisions}
Having introduced the parameter $\Delta\phiS{peng}$ and its role in the pursuit for New Physics
it is interesting to point out some aspects relevant to the experimental measurement of the previous parameter.
First and and foremost by utilizing state of the art technologies scientists have built the most
powerful accelerator, \lhc, at \cern to test, explore and improve Standard Model. The machine is
capable of accelerating two beams of protons up to almost the speed of light and collide them at
a particular point in space called the interaction point, where detectors are located around it.
To put these very energetic collisions into perspective; the energy density of a single proton-proton
collision at \lhc is approximately as high as when the universe was about a bilionth of second old.
This effectively allows particle physicists to look back in time and probe information about the
state of matter, and antimatter, in the early universe.

The \lhcb experiment, located at \cern, is a dedicated experiment to the study of \CP violation.
The design of the detector, both at the hardware and software level, is optimized for detecting
special interactions of {\it heavy} quarks, like the \bquark and the \cquark quarks.
Emphasis is also given to the detection of muons, particularly to the ones that fly
inside a small cone around the interaction point. Note that muons are leptons, defined earlier,
which can be found in the final decay products of most decay channnels that \lhcb is intreated in.

After recording parcicle collions that are intreasting for physics measurements, like $\Delta\phiS{peng}$,
the stored data are further processed such that the presence of noise, or background, is suppressed as much
as possible. In addition biases and finite resolution effects introduced by detector imperfections are
taken into account such that the physics model, which estimates the parameters of interest, is
correceted for these effects and thus provide valid and robust estimates when fitting the data.
The fitting process is based on the principle of maximum likelihood. The likelihood is a
function of the parameters of interest given the observed data. At its maximum the likelihood function
provides the {\it best fit} estimate for the parameters of interest given the data that were
used to build the previous likelihood function.

Visualizing the result of the fit involves plotting the fitted model on top of the data,
see \figref{app_angular_plot_thetas}. The data in that case consist of three variables,
($\cos\thetaK, \cos\thetamu, \phihel$), which are releated to the direction, in 3D space,
of the \BsJpsiPhi decay particles.

           Various components of the model relevant to its \CP structure are shown with colored lines.}
  \label{app_angular_plot_thetas}
\end{figure}

Having performed the likelihood fit to the data and
following the strategy indicated by \cite{Fleischer:1999zi,Faller:2008gt,DeBruyn:2014oga,DeBruyn-thesis}
the final result regarding penguin topology contributions to \phis is shown in the following equation:

\begin{equation}
\label{app_delta_phis_result}
  \DeltaPhisPeng{0}         = 0.00 ^{+0.57}_{-0.80}, \;\;
  \DeltaPhisPeng{\parallel} = 0.06 ^{+0.69}_{-0.92}, \;\;
  \DeltaPhisPeng{\perp}     = 0.17 ^{+0.69}_{-0.92},
\end{equation}

\noindent where quantities are expresed in degrees (\phis is the argument of a complex number).
Note that the parameter $\Delta\phiS{peng}$ is split in its {\it polarization}
components. Essentially the \BsJpsiPhi decay probability, as well as the \phis value
are in principle different depending on the configuration of the particle spin
quantum numbers in the \BsJpsiPhi decay resulting in three polarization components
$\parallel,\perp {\rm and}\; 0$ respectivelly for parallel, perpendicular and longditudinal.
Thus, the penguin parameter $\Delta\phiS{peng}$ is expressed in a similar footing.


\subsubsection{Impact and Conclusions}

The shifts $\Delta\phiS{peng}$ quoted in \equref{app_delta_phis_result}
suggest that contributions of penguin topologies to the \BsJpsiPhi decay amplitude are
small, $<1^\circ$. Given the also small \phis measured value, shown in \equref{app_phis_lhcb},
it becomes mandatory to control penguin contributions in future \phis measurements.
Increasing the amount of data in the \lhc \runtwo might not be enough to yield
a significant claim on the presence of physics beyond the Standard Model and hence
the upgraded \lhcb detector becomes important in the pursuit for New Physics with
\phis in the future.
