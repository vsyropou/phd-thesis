\chapter{Horizontal Reweighting}
\label{AppendixB}

The current appndix addresses the issue of manipulating some input distribution, source, such that
it becomes statistically compatible with a given, target, distribution. A common method to do that
involves binning the two distributions. This method is sometimes called {\it vertical reweighting}
and it is described in \appref{vertical_reweighting}. The main motivation behind the techinique advertised in the current
appendix is to circumvent problems arising from binning distributions, especially when the number of
bins is big. Note that the bigger the number of bins the more precise the matching of the two distributions
is. The advertised techinique is described in \appref{horizontal_reweighting} and a choice for its name could be {\it horizontal reweighting}.
Lastly a typical matching example that is encountered in high energy physics is given \appref{rew_results}.


\subsection{Vertical Reweighting}
\label{vertical_reweighting}

The logic of vertical reweighting is very simple and it is 


\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain how it is done
  \item Show limitations and problems
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Horizontal Reweighting}
\label{horizontal_reweighting}


\begin{itemize}
  \item Describe logic with bullets, or a chart
  \item Elaborate on steps (show math) and cite theorems
\end{itemize}

The techinique presented in the current section is a combination of a few well know mathematical theorems.
The logic of the techinique is inspired by discussions withe Gerhard Raven and Diego Martinez Santos.
