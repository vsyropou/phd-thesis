\label{lhcb_detector}

Here I will present the lhcb detector parts and their performance that are relevant to my analysis.
First give an overview of the experiment cern hep experiments blah blah. Explain what reconstruction
is, how events are processeed triggered etc.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Very briefly describe the detector components.
  \item Describe the relevance and performance of the sub-detectors relevant to my analysis
  \item Emphasize a bit more to the trigger.
  \item Show an event display
  \item Explain why the lhcb is a forward detector. Show bb corss sec-rapidity
  \item Production of \Bs mesons (how many), ALso mention charm production. And recently also with rare kaon physics.
  \item Mention flavour tagging.
\end{itemize}

\section{Tracking System}
The tracking system is used for

Need to mention-describe:
\begin{itemize}
  \item reconstruction
  \item types of tracks
  \item momentum resolution
  \item proper time resolution.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{VeLo}
\subsection{TT}
\subsection{OT}

\section{Particle Identification}
Pid system supresses backgrounds by a lot.
Used in every analysis.
You have those rich detecotrs and the performance is blah.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Electron ID  90 % for ~ 5 % e→h mis-id probability
  \item Kaon ID 95 % for ~ 5 % π→K mis-id probability
  \item Muon ID 97 % for 1-3 % π→μ mis-id probability
\end{itemize}


\section{Muon system}
The muon system has a variant granularity because blah.
The resolution varies from this to that
The efficiency is this

\section{The trigger system}
\label{lhcb_trigger}

Need to mention-describe:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The trigger is responsible for .....
  \item It is consits of L0 Hlt1 hlt2
  \item The output is organised in 4 L0 streams.
  \item Hlt1 and hlt2 is organised in lines.
  \item It is intreasting to see the improvement of the trigger from run one to run two.
  \item Show the organisation of the performance of the muon lines.
\end{itemize}

\section{The \BJpsiKst Decay in \lhcb}
\label{BspsiKst_at_lhcb}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Estimate of the expected yield
  \item Event display
  \item Maybe define observables
\end{itemize}
