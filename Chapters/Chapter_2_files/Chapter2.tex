\section{Particle Identification}
\label{det_pid}
Two particle identification, PID, systems are used in \lhcb to increase the purity of the analysed data.
The \kaon and \pion are a typical pair that are commonly mis-identified in the absence of partice
identification. Furthermore a particle that is not stoped by the calorimeters is most likely identified
as a muon. There are two {\it Cherenkov} based PID sub-detectors in \lhcb, namely \richone and \richtwo,
each one performing better for low and high momentum tracks respectivelly. The pid effieciencies are shown
in the following table

\begin{itemize}
  \item Electron ID  90 % for ~ 5 % e→h mis-id probability
  \item Kaon ID 95 % for ~ 5 % π→K mis-id probability
  \item Muon ID 97 % for 1-3 % π→μ mis-id probability
\end{itemize}

\section{Calorimetery}
\label{det_calo}
Calorimeters provide energy information for neutrals.
Sambling calorimeters, ecal and hcal.
They also stop hadrons, whereas mip muons penetrate led.
Information from calorimeters are not used
Mention spd and ps.

\section{The trigger system}
\label{det_trigger}

Need to mention-describe:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The trigger is responsible for .....
  \item It is consits of L0 Hlt1 hlt2
  \item mention defral triggered events
  \item The output is organised in 4 L0 streams.
  \item Hlt1 and hlt2 is organised in lines.
  \item It is intreasting to see the improvement of the trigger from run one to run two.
  \item Show the organisation of the performance of the muon lines.
\end{itemize}

\section{The \BJpsiKst Decay in \lhcb}
\label{BspsiKst_at_lhcb}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Production of \Bs mesons (how many),
  \item Estimate of the expected yield
  \item Event display
  \item Maybe define observables
\end{itemize}
