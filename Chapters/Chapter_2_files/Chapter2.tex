\section{Particle Identification}
\label{det_pid}

The kaons and pions are idistiguishable in the absence of dedicated particle identification, {\it PID}, detectors. 
Furthermore, a particle that is not stopped by the calorimeters is most likely identified as a muon, 
since muons can penetrate the entire \lhcb detector without decaying. In addition, properly identifing 
electrons, photons and pions is a chalenging task that require sophisticated setup and algorithms.
These experimental dificulties are tackeled by exploiting information from several sub-detector systems;
thus increasing the purity of the analyzed data. 

The two {\it Cherenkov} based PID sub-detectors in \lhcb, \richone and \richtwo, amied at identifying low and 
high momentum tracks respectively. The way the \rich systems provide particle identification information is 
based on the velocity measurement implied by the angle of emmission of a Cherenkov radiation. 
The muon system also plays a role in PID. The presence of hits in the muon stations that 
could be ascocaited to a certain track increse the probability that this track corresponds to real muon, 
see \chapref{Muon_id_hlt} also. Lastly, the calorimeter systems aim at increasing the chances of correctly 
identifieng electrons, photons and pions, as mentioned in \secref{det_calo}.
Further details regarding the PID performance of \lhcb can be found in the overall detector \cite{Aaij:2014jba}, 
\rich system \cite{Adinolfi:1495721}, \muonID \cite{Archilli:1553139} performance studies respectivelly.

\section{Calorimetry}
\label{det_calo}
Calorimeters in \lhcb measure the energy of particles provided that all of the subsequent particle decays are
contained withing the calorimeter. Furthermore in the case of netrual particles, like photons or \piz,
calorimeters are the only mean with which these netrual particles can be detected; since the tracking system
only detect charged particles. There are four relevant sub-detectors
that enable proper calorimetry at \lhcb. First the combination of the {\it Scintillating Pad Detector} (\spd)
and the {\it Pre Shower} (\presh) detectors with a lead layer in-between them enables to distinguish \piz from
photons, and photons from electrons which leave the same signature in the electromagnetic calorimeter.
Subsequently the electromagnetic, \ecal, and hadronic, \hcal, calorimeters measure the energy of photons
and neutral hadrons respectively. The calorimeter system is not explicitly used in the analysis of \chapref{Data_Analysis}.
However, they are implicitly used since information from the \spd and \presh sub-detectors are used
by the \lzero trigger system to estimate the overall {\it multiplicity} of an event. Multiplicity essentialy
provide a quick estimate, to the \lzero trigger system, on wheather a certain event is intrasting from physics
point of view. Furthermore, the lead material that is interlayered between the \ecal and \hcal active detector material,
stops\footnote{Stop in this context means that the particle decays and all its decay products are contained inside the calorimeter
volume, such that energy of the initial particle is estimated.} most of the hadrons and thus preventing them
from being mis-identified by as muons by the subsequent muon stations.

\section{The \BJpsiKst Decay in \lhcb}
\label{BspsiKst_at_lhcb}

The \BsJpsiKst process is a typical channel for which the \lhcb has a high detection efficiency.
The presence of muon in the final state yields a high trigger efficiency, while the intermediate
\Kstarz resonance decays within the \velo into a \Kp and a \pim thus resulting in two Long tracks.
Thanks to PID information and the optimized selection described in \secref{det_pid} most of the bakcground
is filtered out. The only difficult point is the low branching fraction of the \BsJpsiKst decay
compared to the \BdJpsiKst whose invariant mass is very close to the one of the \BsJpsiKst, see \secref{mass_BDTG_selection}.
Thus, special care needs to be taken when modeling the mass distribution of these two channels.
The total \BsJpsiKst yield accumulated over the full \runone is about 1800 signal candidates, see \equref{signal_yields}.
An \lhcb event is shown in \figref{det_evt_display}. A reconstructed \BsJpsiKst decay candidate is shown in
more detail in \figref{det_jpsikst_cand}.
