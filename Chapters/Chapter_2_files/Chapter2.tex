\section{Particle Identification}
\label{det_pid}
Two particle identification, PID, systems are used in \lhcb to increase the purity of the analyzed data.
The \kaon and \pion is a typical pair that are commonly mis-identified in the absence of particle
identification. Furthermore a particle that is not stopped by the calorimeters is most likely identified
as a muon, since muons can penetrate the entire \lhcb detector without decaying. There are two
{\it Cherenkov} based PID sub-detectors in \lhcb, namely \richone and \richtwo, each one performing
better for low and high momentum tracks respectively. The way the PID systems provides particle
identification information is by means of a likelihood ratio of two particle hypothesis.
The nominal PID efficiencies are shown in \tabref{pid_efficiencies}.

\section{Calorimetry}
\label{det_calo}
Calorimeters in \lhcb measure the energy of neutral particles, for example photons or \piz,
as this type of particles are undetectable by the tracking system. There are four relevant sub-detectors
that enable proper calorimetry at \lhcb. First the combination of the {\it Scintillating Pad Detector} (\spd)
and the {\it Pre Shower} (\presh) detectors with a led layer in-between them enables to distinguish \piz from
photons, and photons from electrons which leave the same signature in the electromagnetic calorimeter.
Subsequently the electromagnetic, \ecal, and hadronic, \hcal, calorimeters measure the energy of photons
and neutral hadrons respectively. The calorimeter system is not explicitly used in the analysis of \chapref{Data_Analysis}.
However, they are implicitly used since information from the \spd and \presh sub-detectors are used
by the \lzero trigger system to roughly estimate the energy of an overall event. Furthermore, the
led material that is interlayered between the \ecal and \hcal active detector material, stops\footnote{Stop
in this context means that the particle decays and all its decay products are contained inside the calorimeter
volume, such that energy of the initial particle is estimated.} most of the hadrons and thus preventing them
from being mis-identified by as muons by the subsequent muon stations.

\section{The trigger system}
\label{det_trigger}
\input{Chapters/Chapter_2_files/trigger}

% \section{Favour Tagging}
% \label{det_tagging}
%
% Several important analysis in \lhcb have the feature that either of the initial \B or \Bbar messons
% can decay to the same final state $f$. A typical example is the \BsJpsiPhi decay that is used to
% measure the weak phase \phis, mentioned in \secref{}. In this analsys the precition of the \phis
% measurement increases when the exact flavor of the initial particle is known\footnote{meaning wheather
% the inital particle was a \Bs or \Bsbar, see also \secref{measuring_phis}}. Thus \lhcb has developed
% several {\it flavor tagging} algorithms, \cite{}.

\section{The \BJpsiKst Decay in \lhcb}
\label{BspsiKst_at_lhcb}
{\color{red} To be revisited after I make an event display.}

The \BsJpsiKst process is a typical channel that the \lhcb has a high detection efficiency.
The presence of muon in the final state yields a high trigger efficiency, while the intermediate
\Kstar resonance decays within the \velo into a \kaon and a \pion thus resulting in two long tracks.
Thanks to PID information and the optimized selection described in \secref{det_pid} most of the background
events are filtered out. The only difficult point is the the low branching fraction of \BsJpsiKst process
compared to the \BdJpsiKst which happen to accumulate very close to the \BsJpsiKst events, see \secref{mass_BDTG_selection}.
Thus, special care needs to be taken when modeling the mass distribution of those two channels.
The total \BsJpsiKst signal yield accumulated over the full \runone is about 1800 events, see \equref{signal_yields}.
A typical \BsJpsiKst event is  shown in \figref{det_evt_display}

The event is pretty and has nice tracks of high-low pt. the kst is there the pv is there the sv is there.
