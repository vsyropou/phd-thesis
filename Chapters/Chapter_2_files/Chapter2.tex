\section{Particle Identification}
\label{det_pid}

The kaons and pions are indistinguishable in the absence of dedicated {\it Particle IDentification}, PID, detectors.
Furthermore, a particle that is not stopped by the calorimeters is most likely identified as a muon,
since muons can penetrate the entire \lhcb detector without decaying. In addition, properly identifying
electrons, photons and pions is a challenging task that require sophisticated setup and algorithms.
These experimental difficulties are tackled by exploiting information from several sub-detector systems;
thus increasing the purity of the analyzed data.

The two {\it Cherenkov} based PID sub-detectors, \richone and \richtwo, aim at identifying low and
high momentum tracks respectively. The way the \rich systems provide particle identification information is
based on the velocity measurement implied by the angle of emission of Cherenkov radiation.
The muon system also plays a role in PID. The presence of hits in the muon stations that
could be associated to a certain track increase the probability that this track corresponds to a muon,
see \chapref{Muon_id_hlt}. Lastly, the calorimeter systems aim at increasing the chances of correctly
identifying electrons, photons and pions, as mentioned in the following subsection.
Further details regarding the PID performance of \lhcb can be found in the overall detector \cite{Aaij:2014jba},
\rich system \cite{Adinolfi:1495721}, \muonID \cite{Archilli:1553139} performance studies respectively.

\section{Calorimetry}
\label{det_calo}
Calorimeters in \lhcb measure the energy of particles provided that all of the subsequent particle decays
and interactions are contained within the calorimeter. Furthermore in the case of neutral particles, like photons,
calorimeters are the only means with which these neutral particles can be detected; the tracking system
only detects charged particles. There are four sub-detectors that enable calorimetry at \lhcb.
First the combination of the {\it Scintillating Pad Detector} (\spd)
and the {\it Pre Shower} (\presh) detectors with a lead layer in between them enables to distinguish \piz from
photons, and photons from electrons. Subsequently the electromagnetic, \ecal, and hadronic,
\hcal, calorimeters measure the energy of photons and neutral hadrons respectively.
Note that the \piz decays into two photons as a result the two photons might be interpreated as a single by the \ecal.
The calorimeter system is not explicitly used in the analysis of \chapref{Data_Analysis}.
However, they are implicitly used since information from the \spd and \presh sub-detectors are used
by the \lzero trigger system to estimate the overall {\it multiplicity} of an event. Multiplicity essentially
provide a quick estimate, to the \lzero trigger system, on whether a certain event is interesting from physics
point of view. Furthermore, the lead material that is inter-layered in the \ecal and \hcal active detector material,
stops most of the hadrons and thus preventing them from being mis-identified by as muons by the subsequent muon stations.
Lastly, information from the \ecal and \hcal is taken into account by PID algorithms that expolit information from
the reset of the PID systems.

\section{The \BsJpsiKst Decay in \lhcb}
\label{BspsiKst_at_lhcb}


The \BsJpsiKst process, with \Jpsimumu and \KstKpi, is a typical channel for which \lhcb has a high detection efficiency.
The presence of muon in the final state yields a high trigger efficiency, while the intermediate
\Kstarz resonance decays within the \velo into a \Kp and a \pim thus resulting in two Long tracks.
Thanks to PID information and the optimized selection described in \secref{det_pid} most of the background
is filtered out. The only difficult point is the low branching fraction of the \BsJpsiKst decay
compared to the \BdJpsiKst whose invariant mass is very close to the one of the \BsJpsiKst, see \secref{mass_BDTG_selection}.
Thus, special care needs to be taken when modeling the mass distribution of these two channels.
The total \BsJpsiKst yield accumulated over the full \runone is about 1800 signal candidates, see \equref{signal_yields}.

An \lhcb event is shown in \figref{det_evt_display}, where \ecal and \hcal energy depositions are
shown as blue and orange bars respectively; the length of each bar is proportional to the energy
deposited. Muon hits are illustrated with green blocks. Long tracks are indicated by lines; where
kaons, pions, muons, protons and electrons are represented with red, orange, green, magenta and
blue color respectively. A reconstructed \BsJpsiKst decay candidate is shown in in \figref{det_jpsikst_cand}.
Where \velo tracks are indicated by black lines. Note how some of the \velo tracks appear
to originate from the primary vertex. Also note the how the \Bs final state tracks intersect
at the secondary vertex.
