\section{Particle Identification}
\label{det_pid}
Two particle identification, PID, systems are used in \lhcb to increase the purity of the analysed data.
The \kaon and \pion are a typical pair that are commonly mis-identified in the absence of partice
identification. Furthermore a particle that is not stoped by the calorimeters is most likely identified
as a muon, since muons can penetrate the entire \lhcb detector without decaying. There are two
{\it Cherenkov} based PID sub-detectors in \lhcb, namely \richone and \richtwo, each one performing
better for low and high momentum tracks respectivelly. The way the PID systems provides particle
identification information is by means of a likelihood ratio of two particle hypothesis.
The nominal PID effieciencies are shown in the table \tabref{}

\section{Calorimetery}
\label{det_calo}
Calorimeters in \lhcb measure the energy of neutral particeles, for example photons or \piz,
as this type of particles are undetectable by the trackig system. There are four relevant sub-detectors
that enable proper calorimetry at \lhcb. First the combination of the {\it Scintilating Pad Detector} \spd
and the {\it Pre Shower} detector with a led layer in-between them enables to distinguish \piz from
photons, and photons from electrons which leave the same signature in the electromagnetic calorimeter.
Subsequently the electromagnetic, \ecal, and hadronic, \hcal, calorimeters measure the energy of photons
and neutral hadrons respectively. The calorimeter system is not expliitly used in the analysis of \chapref{Data_Analysis}.
However, they are implicitly used since information from the \spd and \ps sub-detectors are used
by the \lzero trigger system to roughly estimate the energy of an overall event. Furthermore, the
led material that is interlayerd between the \ecal and \hcal active detector material, stops\footnote{Stop
in this context means that the particle decays and all its decay products are contained inside the calorimeter
volume, such that energy of the initial particle is estimated.} most of the hadrons and thus preventing them
from being mis-identified by as muons by the subsequent muon stations.

\section{The trigger system}
\label{det_trigger}
\input{Chapters/Chapter_2_files/trigger}

% \section{Favour Tagging}
% \label{det_tagging}
%
% Several important analysis in \lhcb have the feature that either of the initial \B or \Bbar messons
% can decay to the same final state $f$. A typical example is the \BsJpsiPhi decay that is used to
% measure the weak phase \phis, mentioned in \secref{}. In this analsys the precition of the \phis
% measurement increases when the exact flavor of the initial particle is known\footnote{meaning wheather
% the inital particle was a \Bs or \Bsbar, see also \secref{measuring_phis}}. Thus \lhcb has developed
% several {\it flavor tagging} algorithms, \cite{}.

\section{The \BJpsiKst Decay in \lhcb}
\label{BspsiKst_at_lhcb}

The \BsJpsiKst process is a typical channel that the \lhcb has a high detection efficiency.
The presence of muon in the final state makes yields a hih trigger effciency, while the intermediate
\Kstar resonance decays within the \velo into a \kaon and a \pion thus resulting in two long tracks.
Thanks to the PID information and the optimised selection described in \secref{} most of the background
events are filterd out. The only difficult point is the the low branching fraction of \BsJpsiKst process
compared to the \BdJpsiKst which happen to accumulate very close to the \BsJpsiKst events, see \secref{}.
Thus special care needs to be taken when modeling the mass distribution of those two channells.

The \BsJpsiKst expected yield for the full \runone is about blah, see \equref{}.
A typical \BsJpsiKst event is  shown in \figref{}
