\label{lhcb_detector}

Here i will present the lhcb detector parts and their performance that are relevant to my analysis.
First give an overview of the experiment cern hep experiments blah blah. Explain what reconstruction
is, how events are processeed triggered etc.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Very briefly describe the detector components.
  \item Describe the relevance and performance of the sub-detectors relevant to my analysis
  \item Emphasize a bit more to the trigger.
  \item Show an event display
\end{itemize}

Need to mention-describe:
\begin{itemize}
  \item reconstruction
\end{itemize}



\section{Tracking}
\subsubsection{VeLo}
\subsubsection{OT and others}

\section{Particle Identification}

\section{Muon system}

\section{The trigger system}

Need to mention-describe:
\begin{itemize}
  \item data streams
  \item trigger line
\end{itemize}

\section{The \BJpsiKst Decay in \lhcb}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Production of \Bs mesons
  \item Event display
  \item Estimate of the expected yield
  \item Event display
  \item Maybe define observables
\end{itemize}
