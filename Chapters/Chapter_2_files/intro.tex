The \lhcb experiment is an international collaboration located in the {\it European Organization for Nuclear Research}, \cern.
There are four major experiments at that location; Two of them are general purpose experiments, \atlas and \cms, whereas
\alice and \lhcb, are dedicated to {\it heavy ion} and {\it flavour} physics respectively\footnote{Heavy ion physics
studies the very energetic state of matter where quarks behave almost as free particles. While flavour physics in introduced in \secref{Flavour_Physics}.}.
All of the above experiments aim at detecting, recording and analyzing as many as
possible high energy particle collisions, which are provided by the {\it Large Hadron Collider}, \lhc.
The latter is the world's most powerful particle accelerating machine built so far.
The \lhc machine accelerates, stores and collides two beams of protons. It is also capable of handling
heavy ion beams, \eg led, thus serving the physics program of the \alice experiment.
In both cases storage is achieved by magnetically forcing the beams to follow an elliptical trajectory.
The two beam trajectories are designed such that they collide with each other at four specific {\it interaction points},
where each of the four experiments is located. The \lhc accelerator as well as the four previously
mentioned experiments are $~100\m$ underground, to protect human population from radiation.
Given the complexity and technical difficulties, building, operating and maintaining all these machines
is a remarkable achievement of human collaboration.

As mentioned in the previous paragraph the \lhcb experiment is dedicated to studing flavor physics.
The design of the detector is optimized for this kind of physics and particularly for the detection
of \B mesons, introduced in \secref{Phenomenology}. The latter type of meson contains a \bquark quark
which originates from a proton-proton collision. In \figref{bb_roduction_angles} it can be seen
that \bquark quarks produced in such a collision, cluster mainly along the proton beam axis. In other words
roughly $50\%$ of the \bquark quarks {\it fly} inside a region of $\sim 45^\circ$ solid angle along both
directions of the beam axis. This region is also called {\it forward} region. The geometry of the \lhcb detector,
shown in \figref{lhcb_detector_cross_section}, is such that it exploits this special production feature of \bquark quarks. Implying that
a $4\pi$ detector geometry like the rest of the \lhc experiments, where the center of collision is surrounded
by layers of detectors, is not necessary. Instead the the \lhcb detector covers the forward region along one
of the two directions of the beam axis, implying that roughly $25\%$ of the b quarks produced are detectable
by \lhcb. This forward design allows for increased purity of the recorded \B mesons at the expense of a limited
physics program compared to the rest of the \lhcb experiments.

The full \lhcb detector specifications, design and performance are described in \cite{Aaij:2014jba}.
The approach of the current chapter is to very briefly address the function and performance of the detector components
throughout \secref{det_tracking} - \secref{det_calo}. Emphasis, is given to these sub-detectors that are relevant
to the analysis performed in \chapref{Data_Analysis} as well as to the trigger system which is of crucial importance
to efficiently running the \lhcb experiment.
