\chapter{Muon Identification in the \lhcb High Level Trigger}
\label{Muon_id_hlt}

The \lhcb trigger system has been briefly described in \secref{lhcb_trigger}. The current chapter focuses on the muon identification
part of the trigger. Muons are important for the \lhcb experment, since a large fraction of its physics programme is based on
the identification of muons in the final state: for example the measurement of \phis through \BsJpsiPhi decays, the study of CP
violation through semileptonic decays, and the measurement
in several rare decays such as \BdKstmumu and \Bsmm. It is therefore of major importance to maintain and improve the efficiency
and purity of identified muons in the Run II data-taking of LHCb. During the shutdown period between \runone and II, effort has
been put to re-optimize the software performing the muon identification. A unified software that can be run both online in the
LHCb software trigger and in the offline reconstruction has been obtained. Furthermore, the detection effciency of low momentum
muons is improved given the available comptuting resources of \runtwo. Low momentum muons are intreasting {\color{red} for these analysis, site diego kaon physics}
A brief description of the unified \muonID code is given in \secref{muid_hlt1}. The low momentum muon efficiency optimization
is addressed in \secref{mvm_algorrithm}.
