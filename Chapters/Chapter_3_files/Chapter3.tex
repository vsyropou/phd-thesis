\chapter{High Level Trigger Muon Identification in \runtwo}
\label{Muon_id_hlt}

The \lhcb trigger system has been briefly described in \secref{lhcb_trigger}. The current chapter focuses on the muon identification
part of the trigger system, hearafter \muonID. Muons are important for the \lhcb experment, since a large fraction of its physics programme is based on
the identification of muons in the final state: for example the measurement of \phis through \BsJpsiPhi decays, the study of CP
violation through semileptonic decays, and several rare decays such as \BdKstmumu and \Bsmm.
It is therefore of major importance to maintain and improve the efficiency and purity of identified muons in the Run II data-taking of LHCb.

During the shutdown period between \runone and II, effort has been put to re-optimize the \muonID software.
Furthermore, the detection effciency of low momentum muons is improved given the available
comptuting resources for \runtwo. The latter improvement boosts the physics program of \lhcb that involves
rare decays of strange\footnote{These are particles that consists of a strange quark combined with ligter ones.}
particles \eg \cite{LHCB-CONF-2016-013-001,LHCb-CONF-2016-012}. A brief quantitative description of the unified
\muonID is given in \secref{muid_hlt1}, whereas the low momentum muon efficiency optimization is addressed in \secref{mvm_algorrithm}.
