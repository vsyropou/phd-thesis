\chapter{High Level Trigger Muon Identification in \runtwo}
\label{Muon_id_hlt}


Muons are easy to identify as they penetrate matter deeply.


Muons are important for the \lhcb experiment and are easy to identify since they penetrate matter deeply.
Therefore they provide a robust way to identify \jpsi paricles. Given that a large fraction of the \lhcb physics
program is based on the identification of muons in the final state: for example the measurement of \phis through
\BsJpsiPhi decays, the study of \CP violation through semileptonic decays, and several rare decays such as
\BdKstmumu and \Bsmm. It is therefore of major importance to maintain and improve the efficiency and purity of identified muons in
the \runtwo data-taking of \lhcb. During the shutdown period between \runone and 2, effort has been put to
optimize the muon identification software, \muonID, which is used in the \lhcb trigger system, introduced in \secref{det_trigger}.
A brief quantitative description of the \muonID improvements is given in \secref{muid_hlt1}.
Furthermore, special care is taken to improve the detection efficiency of low momentum muons, this issue is
addressed in \secref{mvm_algorrithm}. Note that the latter improvement is particularly useful for the part
of the \lhcb physics program involving certain newly introduced rare processes, \eg \Sigmapmumu \cite{LHCB-CONF-2016-013-001} and \Ksmumu \cite{LHCb-CONF-2016-012}.
