\chapter{High Level Trigger Muon Identification in \runtwo}
\label{Muon_id_hlt}

The \lhcb trigger system has been briefly described in \secref{lhcb_trigger}. The current chapter focuses on the muon identification
part of the trigger system. Muons are important for the \lhcb experment, since a large fraction of its physics programme is based on
the identification of muons in the final state: for example the measurement of \phis through \BsJpsiPhi decays, the study of CP
violation through semileptonic decays, and the measurement
in several rare decays such as \BdKstmumu and \Bsmm. It is therefore of major importance to maintain and improve the efficiency
and purity of identified muons in the Run II data-taking of LHCb. During the shutdown period between \runone and II, effort has
been put to re-optimize the \muonID code. Furthermore, the detection effciency of low momentum muons is improved given the available
comptuting resources for \runtwo. Low momentum muons will enavle to performa analysis with softer muon spectrum, \eg \cite{LHCB-CONF-2016-013-001,LHCb-CONF-2016-012},
and enrich the \lhcb physics program. A brief description of the unified muon identification code (\muonID) is given in \secref{muid_hlt1}.
The low momentum muon efficiency optimization is addressed in \secref{mvm_algorrithm}.
