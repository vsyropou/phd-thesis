\chapter{High Level Trigger Muon Identification in \runtwo}
\label{Muon_id_hlt}

Muons are important for the \lhcb experiment, since a large fraction of its physics program is based on
the identification of muons in the final state: for example the measurement of \phis through \BsJpsiPhi decays,
the study of \CP-violation through semileptonic decays, and several rare decays such as \BdKstmumu and \Bsmm.
It is therefore of major importance to maintain and improve the efficiency and purity of identified muons in
the Run II data-taking of LHCb. During the shutdown period between \runone and II, effort has been put to
re-optimize the muon identification software, \muonID, which is used in the \lhcb trigger system, introduced in \secref{det_trigger}.
A brief quantitative description of the \muonID improvements is given in \secref{muid_hlt1}.
Furthermore, special care is taken to improve the detection efficiency of low momentum muons, this issue is
addressed in \secref{mvm_algorrithm}. Note that the latter improvement is particularly useful for the part
of the \lhcb physics program involving certain rare processes, \eg \cite{LHCB-CONF-2016-013-001,LHCb-CONF-2016-012}.
