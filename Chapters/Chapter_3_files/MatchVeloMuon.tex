\subsection{The MatchVeloMuon algorithm}
\label{sec:muon_matching}

In \runone all VELO tracks in \hltone were filtered by the \mvm tool. This matched a VELO track to hits in the muon
stations before the \FwD tracking algorithm was run and the VELO track was upgraded to a long track (See \figref{fig:hlt1_algo_seq}(a)).
If the VELO track passed certain requirements imposed by \mvm it was accepted, otherwise the VELO track was discarded
permanently and not processed further by the \hltone Muon lines.

The \mvm tool took a VELO track as input and searched for hits inside a search window in the M3 muon station.
% \footnote{M3 is the first station
% to look at for two reasons. First the occupancy in M2 is very high thus creating a huge number of seed
% hits out of a single VELO track candidate. Second the offline muon reconstruction will always fail if
% there is no M3 muon hit asigned to a VELO track.}
No momentum or charge information was available at that stage of reconstruction. Thus the size of the search window (FoI)
was defined based on the maximum deflection that the magnetic field would give to a track passing trough the
\lhcb magnet. For a given magnetic field strength map the maximum deflection was calculated assuming
a track momentum of 6 \gevc and assuming the positive and negative charge hypothesis.
All M3 hits that are inside the FoI are called seed hits.
At this stage an estimate of the momentum of the initial VELO track was available assuming a certain seed hit
and using the kick method\cite{CERN-THESIS-2015-102}. Based on this momentum estimate it was possible
to extrapolate the track and associate additional hits from the rest of the muon stations.
At least 3 hits in the muon stations M2-M5 were required by the algorithm in order to accept the initial VELO track.
At the end of this procedure all muon candidate tracks that could result from an initial VELO track were considered.
As a last step the candidate muon tracks were filtered with a \chisq per Degrees of Freedom (DoF) requirement.
The last was a quality cut to reduce the chances that random combinations fake a real muon track.

Once a track was identified as muon with the \mvm tool it was upgraded to long track with
the forward tracking algorithm after which further selection criteria and the standard \kw{IsMuon} algorithm were applied.


\subsection{Upgrade to MatchVeloTTMuon }
\label{sec:matchvelottmuon}

As described in Ref.\cite{LHCb-PUB-2015-005} in the \runtwo data-taking all the tracks are upgraded as VELO-TT segments,
exploiting information from the \ttracker tracking station which, being closer to the magnet,
guarantees a first momentum estimated. As already said, forward tracking is then passed on
all tracks above 500 \mevc of \pt.

For tracks below 500 \mevc of \pt the \mvm algorithm could still recover efficiency for the muon lines,
however in view of the already upgraded VELO-TT tracks, this tool was rewritten in order to better exploit these tracks.

In addition to the above mentioned improvement there are several more points that \mvm can benefit from.
First due to the fact that the \veloTTCand have momentum and charge information, it is possible to open better
FoI in M3 to search for seed hits. The sign information of \veloTTCand halves the FoI size
and the momentum knowledge reduces the FoI size further, since the assumption of a momentum of 6 \mev
is no longer necessary. The last carries a big improvement potential
since smaller FoIs implies less seed hits in M3 and thus less fake muon candidates and less processing time per input VELO track.
Another improvement that follows naturally from the previous one is the usage of offline FoIs.
The offline FoIs are momentum dependant search windows that are used
by the \muonID in the offline muon reconstruction. It is trivial to see that the combination of the above improvements
make the extrapolation of a VELO-TT segment to the M3 muon station more precise.


%% The effect of better FoI is also depicted in the middle row of \figref{fig:mvm_extrap}, where the distrance $\text{d}^{\text{true-extrap}}_x$ between the true M3 hit and the
%% extrapolation point (from veloTT to M3) is shown. There are two things that improve when comparing the left (\mvm) and right (\mvTTm). First the double structure
%% peak\footnotemark is not present anymore and the width is significantly imporoved, impling that the extrapolation to M3 is more precise.

%% \footnotetext[10]{ The structure is caused by a not perfect parametrization of the magnetic field.}

Furthermore, the \chisq fit that \mvm calculates is also improved since the vertical plane is added in \mvTTm. In more detail, the \chisq fit is a straight line fit
performed to all the possible muon candidate tracks that originate from the seed hits of a given initial VELO track. The fit used to be performed only in the horizontal
plane ($x$ coordinate ). Adding the vertical plane improves the discriminating power of the \chisq.

%% The \chisq distributions for two momentum ranges are show in \figref{fig:mvm_chiSq}

Finally, the efficiency curves after all the improvements are shown in \figref{fig:mvm_eff}.
Top row shows the efficiency for \mvm versus $p$ and \pt, whereas
the bottom one the \mvTTm. Both algorithms get the same input tracks, namely \veloTTCand.
For low momenta the improvement is clear, whereas for high momenta
there is no efficiency loss within the statistical uncertainties. However any potential loss
after 500 \mevc in \pt is not relevant since, as it was stated
in the beginning of the current section, \mvTTm runs only on tracks with low momenta.

Furthermore, the per event processing time is also reduced by $\sim 20\% - 40 \%$ using \mvTTm
with respect to the old \mvm, see \tabref{tab:mvm_time_diff}.
This is clearly because of the less number of seed hits in M3 resulting from the smaller FoI. Lastly, an important caveat arises from the fact that there can be tracks
that are labelled as \veloTTCand but they actually do not have \ttracker hits. These tracks are normal high \pt tracks that pass through the \ttracker station's inner hole
where there is no active detector material.
Thus they are just copied to the list of output tracks when the \veloTTCand are reconstructed.
\mvTTm does not discard this type of tracks either but deals with them properly
by invoking the old \mvm algorithm for such type of tracks.
