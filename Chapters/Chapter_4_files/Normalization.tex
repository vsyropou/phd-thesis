The current section addresses the issue of the \BsJpsiKst branching fraction estimation, hearafter $\BRof\BsJpsiKst$,
which is one of the necessary ingredients towards estimating the penguin contributions to \phis, covenred in \secref{penguins_formalism}.
Absolute branching fraction measurements are more complecated to perform compared to a relative ones. Thus the $\BRof\BsJpsiKst$
is normalised with respect to the $\BRof\BsJpsiPhi$, which is suitable given the relevant formalism, see \secref{penguins_formalism},
for the penguin contribution determination.

\begin{align}
\frac{\BRof\BsJpsiKst}{\BRof\BsJpsiPhi} = \frac{N_{\BsJpsiKpi}}{N_{\BsJpsiKK}} &\times \frac{\varepsilon_{\BsJpsiPhi}^{MC}}{\varepsilon_{\BsJpsiKst}^{MC}} \times \nonumber \\
                                                                          &\times \frac{\omega_{\BsJpsiPhi}}{\omega_{\BsJpsiKst}} \times \frac{\BRof{\phi\to\kaon^+\kaon^-}}{\BRof{\Kstar\to\kaon\pion}},
\label{norm_jpsiPhi}
\end{align}

\noindent The $\BRof\BsJpsiKst$ formula as shown in \equref{norm_jpsiPhi} is detached from the angular analisis. It requires as input the observed number
of \BsJpsiKst and \BsJpsiPhi events. The first one is taken from \equref{signal_yields} as for the later a bit more efford is needed.
Particularly the selection steps applied to $\BsJpsiPhi$ (also refered to as reference chanell) are chosen such that they are as
similar as possible to that of \BsJpsiKst in \tabref{Bs2JpsiKstSelection}. Also the BDTG clasifier is applied to the refference chanell
with the same cut values as in the \BsJpsiKst chanell. The ratio of observed number of events is represented by the first fraction in \equref{norm_jpsiPhi},
Whereas the ratio of total efficiencies between the two chanells by the second. The last is corrected for differenceses in efficiencies between real and
simulated data. Addionally there is a correction factor to account for the presence of \swave in the two
chanells\footnote{The penguin estiamtion assumes no \swave contributiuon to \BsJpsiKst. Each of the factors $\omega$ in \equref{norm_jpsiPhi} correspond
to the ratio of two angular \pdfs. One with the \swave parameters set to zero and \pwave to those obtaind in the angular fit,  whereas the other
with both \pwave and \swave parameters as obtained from the same fit. The $\omega$ factors can be understood as overal \swave fraction which
corrects the observed number of events.
}. The branching fractions of the intermediate resonance to the final state di-hadron system are obtained from \cite{PDG}
\footnote{ $\BRof{\Kstar\to\kaon\pion} = 2/3$ whereas $\BRof{\phi\to\kaon^+\kaon^-}\simeq 1/2$}.
The $\BRof\BsJpsiPhi$ \cite{SheldonKK} is updated with the latest hadronization \bquark quark fraction
ratio\footnote{The quantity \fdfs expresses the ratio of probabilities that a \bquark quark will form a messon with a \dquark quark or an \squark quark}
\cite{LHCb-CONF-2013-011}. Whereas the efficiency and the angular correction ratios are about $2$ and $0.9$ respectivelly.

\begin{equation}
\frac{\BRof\BsJpsiKst}{\BRof\BsJpsiPhi} = (4.09 \pm 0.20 ({\rm stat}) )\% .\\
\label{norm_jpsiPhi_result}
\end{equation}

\noindent Using all the above information the right hand side of \equref{norm_jpsiPhi} can be evaluated resulting in
the branching fractions ratio of \equref{norm_jpsiPhi_result}, or using the value of $\BRof\BsJpsiPhi$
one gets the absolute $\BRof\BsJpsiKst$, in \equref{Br_JpsiPhi}

\begin{equation}
\label{Br_JpsiPhi}
\BRof\BsJpsiKst_{\phi} = (4.25 \pm 0.20  \text{(stat)} \pm 0.36 (\BRof\BsJpsiPhi))\times 10^{-5}
\end{equation}

\noindent Only statistical errors are shown in the above values. Systematic uncertainties are treated seperatelly in \secref{systemics}
