\chapter{Data Analysis}
\label{Data_Analysis}

In the current chapter the parameters to estimate the contribution of penguin topologies to the \BsJpsiPhi
decay are determined. This is achieved by analyzing the \runone \lhcb data, accumulated over the years 2011 and 2012,
which correspond to a total integrated luminosity of 3\invfb. To fit these data, a weighted maximum likelihood fit
is performed to the angular distributions of \BsJpsiKst, where the weights have been computed with the \sPlot
technique \cite{splot} described in \secref{sWeighting_and_mass}.
Prior to any analysis, the data obtained from the detector are filtered to reduce the presence of
background events. Thus the current chapter addresses the event selection first and then the angular analysis.

\secref{Event_Selection} describes the steps employed to reduce background in the data. For this purpose
it is necessary to model the $J/\psi K\pi$ invariant mass distribution in the region of the \Bs meson, which
is addressed in \secref{sWeighting_and_mass}. In \secref{Angular_Analysis} the angular analysis is described.\\
