\chapter{Data Analysis}
\label{Data_Analysis}

The parameters of interest as described in \chapref{Introduction} are extracted from the analysis of the
\runone \lhcb data accumulated over the years 2011 and 2012, which correspond to a total integrated luminosity
of 3\invfb. The fit to these data is a weighted Maximum Mikelihood fit to the angular distributions of \BsJpsiKst,
where the weights have been computed with the \sPlot technique \cite{splot}. The extracted parameters of interest are polarization
fractions and amplitude phases of the previously mentioned decay chanell. Prior to the angular analysis the data as 
they come straight from the detector need to be filterd to reduce the presence of background events. Thus the current
chapter addresses first the event selection and then the angular analysis of the selected data.

\secref{Event_Selection} describes all the steps involded to reduce background in the data. For this purpose
it is necessary to model the invariant mass distribution of the \BJpsiKpi decay chanells, which is addressed
in \secref{The_Invariant_Mass_Distribution}. In \secref{Angular_Analysis} the details of estimating the parameters
of intrest are presented in steps.

% Section Event Selection
\section{Event Selection}
\label{Event_Selection}

There are effectivelly four stages of offline event selection taking place after the data has been written out by the detector. 
First a set of rough selection criteria is applied. Those cuts are quantities like track and vertex quality {\color{red}(jargon:track and vertex?)},
track impact parameter, mass ranges of mother and daugther particles, particle identification and transverse momentum. A detalied 
table of those cuts is given in \appref{Stripping}. The purpose of those cuts is to perform a first rough rejection of the combinatorial background
and prepare the data for the next stage of selection. The rest of the selection steps are described in each of the subsequent subsections.
