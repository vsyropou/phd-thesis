\chapter{Data Analysis}
\label{Data_Analysis}

The parameters of interest as described in \chapref{Introduction} {\color{red} which section} are extracted from the analysis of the
\runone \lhcb data accumulated over the years 2011 and 2012, which correspond to a total integrated luminosity
of 3\invfb. To fit these data a weighted Maximum Mikelihood fit to the angular distributions of \BsJpsiKst is performed,
where the weights have been computed with the \sPlot technique \cite{splot} described in \secref{Combinatorial_Background}.
Prior to any angular analysis the data as they come straight from the detector need to be filterd to reduce the presence of 
background events. Thus the current chapter addresses first the event selection and then the angular analysis.

\secref{Event_Selection} describes all the steps involded to reduce background in the data. For this purpose
it is necessary to model the invariant mass distribution of the \BJpsiKpi decay chanells, which is addressed
in \secref{Combinatorial_Background}. In \secref{Angular_Analysis} the angular analysis is described.\\

% Section Event Selection
\section{Event Selection}
\label{Event_Selection}

There are effectivelly four stages of offline event selection taking place after the data has been written out. 
First a set of rough pre-selection criteria is applied (hearafter {\it Stripping}). Those cuts are quantities like track and vertex quality {\color{red}(jargon:track and vertex?)},
track impact parameter, mass ranges of mother and daugther particles, particle identification and transverse momentum. A detalied 
table of the Stripping cuts is given in \tabref{Bs2JpsiKstSelection}. The purpose of stripping is to perform a first rough rejection of the combinatorial
background and prepare the data for the next stage of selection (Stripping is also a way to save disk space for offline event storage, since it is impossible
to save anything that the detector writes out). The rest of the selection steps after Stripping are described in each of the subsequent subsections.
