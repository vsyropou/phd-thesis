\chapter{Data Analysis}
\label{Data_Analysis}

The parameters of interest as described in \secref{TheBsJpsiKstDecay} are extracted from the analysis of the
\runone \lhcb data accumulated over the years 2011 and 2012, which correspond to a total integrated luminosity
of 3\invfb. To fit these data a weighted maximum likelihood fit to the angular distributions of \BsJpsiKst is performed,
where the weights have been computed with the \sPlot technique \cite{splot} described in \secref{sWeighting_and_mass}.
Prior to any analysis the data obtained from the detector need to be filtered to reduce the presence of 
background events. Thus the current chapter addresses first the event selection and then the angular analysis.

\secref{Event_Selection} describes all the steps involved to reduce background in the data. For this purpose
it is necessary to model the $J/\psi K\pi$ invariant mass distribution in the region of the \Bs meson, which
is addressed in \secref{sWeighting_and_mass}. In \secref{Angular_Analysis} the angular analysis is described.\\
