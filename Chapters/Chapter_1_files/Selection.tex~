In this section we present the real data samples (\secref{realData}) and simulated data samples (\secref{MCsamples})
used, and the stripping and offline selection (\secref{secStrip}). We reconstruct the \jpsi\ into $\mu^+\mu^-$ and 
the $\bar{K}^{*0}$ into $K^-\pi^+$, as well as their charge conjugated decays. A very large \BdJKst component is 
present in the data and taken into account in the analysis, also used as normalisation channel as well 
(see \secref{sec:norm_JpsiBdKst}). The selection done at the stripping level is ``cut-based'', while the one done 
offline uses boosted decision trees with gradient boosting (BDTG).
