\subsubsection{The \phis parameter in $b \rightarrow ssl$ transitions}
\phis is a parameter that arises in the b2ssl transitions, which are CP eigenstates.
See diagram,
It is an overal phase difference of two diagrams. The decay and the mixing.

The assymetry can be computed by inspectign the diagrams using the pahse definitions in blah.
Give references.
