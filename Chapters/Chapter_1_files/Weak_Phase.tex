The weak phase \phis is an important parameter of the \BBbarSyst system. It is related to the third
type of CP-Violation mentioned in \secref{Phenomenology}, nameley in the interference between
two decay amplitudes, see \figref{interference}. In the current section the parameter \phis
and its relevance to the search for new particles is introduced. The status of the \phis
measurements concludes the section.

The parameter \phis manifests in the so called $\bquark \rightarrow \cquark\cquarkbar\squark $ transitions, where the
\bquark of the \Bs meson decays into three other quarks. In addtion, the final state of the \Bs meson has to be a CP eigenstate,
which implies that both \Bs and \Bsb can decay into it.

A common parameter that is used to parametrize CP violation in the interference between mixing and decay is shown in \equref{lambda_cpv}.

\begin{equation}
 \lambda_{f} = \frac{q}{p} \frac{\bar{A}_f}{A_f}. % \equiv \left|\lambda_f\right| e^{i\phis}.
\label{lambda_cpv}
\end{equation}

\noindent The ratios $|\qoverp|$ and $|\nicefrac{A_f}{\bar{A}_{f}}|$ are ascociated to the mixing and decay parts of \figref{interference} respectivelly.
Given the so called {\it master equations}{\color{red} ref pdg} for the decay rates of a \Bs and \Bsb
to a final state $f$, the asymmetry due to the interference between mixing and decay\footnote{assuming $|\qoverp|=1$ and $|\nicefrac{A_f}{\bar{A}_{\bar{f}}}| = 1$ consistet with {\color{red} ref for nocpv in mix and decay}.}
is shown in \equref{cpv_interf}

\newcommand{\half}{\frac{1}{2}}
\begin{equation}
  \Acp{\text{inter}}(t) = \frac{ - \Im(\lambda_f) \sin(\Delta m_s t)} {\cosh(\half \Delta\Gamma_s t) - \Re(\lambda_f)\sinh(\half\Delta\Gamma_s t)}.
\label{cpv_interf}
\end{equation}

\noindent It is intreasting to point out that according to \equref{cpv_interf} CP asymmetry can be observed in the interference of decay and mixing
even if no CP-Violation occurs in both the mixing and the decay. Since the CP asymmetry can vanish at a certain point of time or for a given time
\equref{cpv_interf} has to remain time dependent.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \caption{{\color{red} Fix this to look more like \figref{QuarkMixing} and put ckm elements on the vertices}. Explain tha this is called tree diagram}
  \label{bs2jpsiphi}
\end{figure}

Given a certain final state $f$ \equref{lambda_cpv} can be expresed as a combination of CKM elements and thus obtain an
estimate on $\Im(\lambda_f)$ based on the Standard Model. The typical choise for $f$ is the $\jpsi\phi$ for reasons
explained later in this section. The leading order diagrams for the \BsJpsiPhi decay and the \BBbarSyst mixing are
shown in \figref{bs2jpsiphi} and \figref{bs_box} repsectivelly. From those diagrams the $\qoverp$ and $\nicefrac{A_f}{\bar{A}_{f}}$
can be read as shown in \equref{qoverp}\footnote{Here it has been used {\color{red} equation blah from pdg} } and \equref{af_afbar} repsectivelly.

\begin{equation}
 \frac{q}{p} = \frac{\Vtb^*\Vts}{\Vtb\Vts^*}
\label{qoverp}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
 \frac{\bar{A}_{\jpsi\phi}} {A_{\jpsi\phi}} = \frac{\Vcb\Vcs^*}{\Vcb^*\Vcs}
\label{af_afbar}
\end{equation}

\noindent From \equref{qoverp}, \equref{af_afbar} and \equref{lambda_cpv} the imaginary part of $\lambda_{f}$ is now computed in,
\equref{phis_def}\footnote{Based on the fact that for a complex number's argument, $\argu{z}$ it is: $\argu{z^{-1}}=\argu{-z}=\argu{z^*}=-\argu{z}$}.

\begin{align}
  \centering
 \Im(\lambda_f) =& \sin\parenthesis{ \argu{\frac{\Vtb^*\Vts}{\Vtb\Vts^*}} + \argu{\frac{\Vcb\Vcs^*}{\Vcb^*\Vcs}} } \nonumber \\
                =& \sin\parenthesis{ \argu{\parenthesis{\Vtb^*\Vts}^2}    + \argu{\frac{1}{\parenthesis{\Vcb^*\Vcs}^2}} }
                = \sin\parenthesis{  2 \; \argu{\frac{\Vtb^*\Vts}{\Vcb^*\Vcs}} } \nonumber \\
                =& \sin\parenthesis{-2\betas}
                \equiv \sin\parenthesis{\phis}
 \label{phis_def}
\end{align}

\noindent An additional implication arises from the choice of the $\jpsi\phi$ as the final state.
Specifically due to the fact that the last particles have a non zero spin quantum number, their combined wavefunction
is not a pure cp eigenstate. The eigenvalue($+1$ or $-1$) of the combined wavefunction dependants on the total angular momentum
$l$ of the $\jpsi$ and $\phi$ particles. This dependancy has to be taken into acount in \equref{phis_def} resulting in \equref{phis_jpsiphi_def}

\begin{equation}
 \Im(\lambda_{\jpsi\phi}) = (-1)^l\sin\parenthesis{\phis}
 \label{phis_jpsiphi_def}
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Measuring \phis with the \lhcb detector}
The parameter \phis has been measuremed in the \lhcb experiment by analysing the decays of \BsJpsiPhi {\color{red} ref 3fb papaer}.
The particular choise of the last final state, where \phiKK and \Jpsimumu, was to do with several reasons. First the high number
of selected \BsJpsiPhi decays available at \lhcb, roughly $90$k at the end of the \runtwo is an advantage. Second there are no other
particles, decaying to a $K^+K^-K$, close to the mass of the $\phi$ particle. This allows for the analysis to be
independant\footnote{There is some residual dependance left, which is very similar to what is described in \secref{Kpi_Invariant_mass}. }
of the \mkk mass variable and thus much simpler. However an angular analysis is necessary to disentangle the posible polarisations
of the intermediate particles $\jpsi$ and $\phi$. This way the CP eigenvalue of their combined wavefunction, used in \equref{phis_jpsiphi_def},
can be determined. In addition, as it was already implied \phis can be correctly probed only when the time dependance of the \BsJpsiPhi decays
is taken into
account\footnote{Specifically \phis is the amplitude of the $\ket{\Bs{}_{,H}}$ and $\ket{\Bs{}_{,L}}$ time distribution oscilations
mentioned in and shown in {\color{red} ref to something.} }.
Furthermore knowledge on wheather the \Bs oscilated to a \Bsb or not before decaying into the final state $\jpsi\phi$
improves the sensitivity of the \phis measuremnt. This is called {\it flavour tagging} and it complicates the analysis
further\footnote{Add also the experimental effects such as angular and time efficiencies and time resolution and morel.}.

             mentioned in \equref{} is illustrated by the green elipse. The combined measurements agree with the Standard Model

The status of the \phis measurements is shown in \figref{hfag_phis_dg}, where \lhcb has the most precise measurement to date.
The combined \phis value from the \lhcb experiment {\color{red} cite phiscombi} is shown in \equref{phis_result}. The last agrees with the Standard Model
predictions within the current experimental ucertainty.
