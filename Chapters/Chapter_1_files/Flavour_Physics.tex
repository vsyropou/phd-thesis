As it was mentioned in \secref{The_Standard_Model} quarks and leptons acquire mass through the Yukawa term
of the Standard Model lagrangian. An important aspect of the weak interaction, emerges from that term,
namelly the {\it quark flavour mixing}. A brief description of the last and its relevance to CP-Violation is given in what follows.
The section concludes with introducing the so called {\it CKM-mixing matrix}, which is the core of the
{\it flavor physics} in the quark sector of the Standard Model.

\subsubsection{Quark Flavour Mixing}
By applying the higgs mechanism {\color{red} refff} to the Standard Model lagrangian the higgs field obtains a
{\it vacum expectation value}, which is the lowest value of the higgs field potential.
After this step the Yukawa term for the quark fields is shown in \equref{yukawa_flavour},
 ignoring quark-higgs field interaction terms.

\begin{subequations}
\label{yukawa_flavour}
  \begin{align}
  % -\mathscr{L}_{\text{Yukawa}} = M_{ij}^d \bar{d_{Li}} d_{Rj} + M_{ij}^u \bar{u_{Li}} u_{Rj} + h.c.,
  -\mathscr{L}_{\text{Yukawa}} &= \left[ y_{ij}^d \bar{d}_{Li} d_{Rj} + y_{ij}^u \bar{u}_{Li} u_{Rj} \right] \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}} + h.c. + ...  \\
                               &= \left[ m_{ij}^d \bar{d}_{Li} d_{Rj} + m_{ij}^u \bar{u}_{Li} u_{Rj} \right] + h.c. + ...,  \\
                               \text{with} \;\;\; m^{u,d}_{i,j} = \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}} y_{ij}^{u,d} & \nonumber
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

\noindent where $v$ is the higgs vacum expectation value and $y_{ij}^{u,d}$ are complex valued numbers called {\it yukawa couplings}.
The last are free parametres that represent the coupling strength between higgs and quark fields.
Note that for equations \equref{yukawa_flavour} to \equref{CClagrangian} it is implied that $u$ and $d$ indicate
an up or a down type quark. The exact generation of the up(down) type quark is specified by the indices $i,j$.
Whereas, indices $L,R\;$ idicate the left or right handedness of the quark field.
Finally the matrix $\bf m^{u,d}$ expresees the desired quark masses.

The quark fields, $u$ and $d$,  in \equref{yukawa_flavour} have a definite quantum number that labels the generation to which they belong
to and also wheather they are of up or down type. This quantum number is commonly called {\it flavour} and thus the quark fields
are flavour eigenstates. By constraction the mass matrix is not diagonal which means that
a quark with a well defined flavour does not have a well defined mass. Or in more formal pharasing flavour and mass eigenstates of
the quark fields do not coincide. In order to obtain propper quark masses the matrix $\bf m^{u,d}$ has to be diagonalised, as shown in \equref{diagM}.

\begin{equation}
  m^{d,u}_{\text diag} = V_L^{d,u} m^{d,u} \left(V_R^{d,u}\right)^{\dagger},
  \label{diagM}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the matrices $V$ are required to be unitary. Since \equref{yukawa_flavour} has to stay intact after $m^{d,u}$ is replaced with
$m^{d,u}_{\text diag}$, the quark fields need to be rotated, as shown in \equref{quark_rotation} such that they cancell the additional $V$ matrices
of \equref{diagM}.

\begin{equation}
  \left( d_{i}^m \right)_{L,R} = \left( V^d_{ij} d_{j} \right)_{L,R}, \;\;\;\; \left( u_{i}^m \right)_{L,R} = \left( V^u_{ij} u_{j} \right)_{L,R}
  \label{quark_rotation}
\end{equation}

\noindent Since the quark fields are still flavour eigenstetes in the rest of the Standard Model lagrangian,
the field rotations of \equref{quark_rotation} need to be applied there as well. Specifically
to the kinetic term involving quark interactions with the charged weak bosons \Wpm, also known as {\it charged current}
interaction, shown in \equref{CClagrangian}. In the last equation the charged current interaction is exressed in two ways.
Once with quark fields expresed as flavour eigenstates, \equref{CClagrangianInt}, and second with the quarks as mass eigenstates, \equref{CClagrangianMass}.

\begin{subequations}
  \label{CClagrangian}
  \begin{align}
    \mathscr{L}_{\text{Kinetic}}^{CC} & \propto \bar{u}_{Li} \gamma_\mu {\Wm}^\mu d_{Ri} + \bar{d}_{Li} \gamma_\mu {\Wp}^\mu u_{Ri}  \label{CClagrangianInt} \\
                                      & \propto \bar{u}_{Li}^m  {V_{\text{CKM}}} \gamma_\mu {\Wm}^\mu d_{Ri}^m + \bar{d}_{Li}^m V_{\text{CKM}} {\Wp}^\mu \gamma_\mu u_{Ri}^m \label{CClagrangianMass} \\
                                      \text{with} \;\;\; V_{\text{CKM}} \equiv V^u_LV^{d\dagger}_L, & \nonumber
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

\noindent and \Wpm the charged weak boson fields, whereas $\gamma_\mu$ are Dirac matrices.
The matrix $V_{\text{CKM}}$ is the so called {\it CKM mixing matrix}, shown in \equref{quark_field_rotation}.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{pmatrix} \dquark \\ \squark \\ \bquark  \end{pmatrix} =
  \underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} \Vud & \Vus & \Vub \\ \Vcd & \Vcs & \Vcb \\ \Vtd & \Vts & \Vtb \end{pmatrix}}_{V_{\text{CKM}}}
    \begin{pmatrix} \dquark^m \\ \squark^m \\ \bquark^m  \end{pmatrix}
  \label{quark_field_rotation}
  \end{equation}

The charged current term, \equref{CClagrangian}, incorporates an important aspect of the weak interaction,
namelly the {\it quark flavor mixing}. The last is due to the fact that quark mass eigenstates are superpositions
of the flavour eigenstates.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  {\sffamily \input{Figures/Chapter1/QuarkMixing.tex}}
  \caption{Feynman diagram where an up-type quark couples to any of the three, ($d,s,b$), down type quarks,
           via a \Wp boson. Time flows from left to right.}
  \label{QuarkMixing}
\end{figure}

\noindent By construction the $V_{\text{CKM}}$ rotates only the down type quarks, impling that
the mass eigenstates of the up-type quarks are identical to the flavour eigenstates. Thus an up type quark
changes its flavour to any of the down type quarks, see \figref{QuarkMixing}, with a certain probabilty.
The probability of such a transitions is given by the elements of the CKM mixing matrix, or simply CKM matrix.

\subsubsection{CKM mixing matrix}
The CKM matrix, is a complex matrix which as already mentioned describes the streanght of quark couplings,
or in other words the probability of a certain quark flavour transition. The elements of the CKM matrix have been measured, see Chapter 12 of~\cite{PDG},
showing an intreasting structure, see \equref{CKMmatrix}. Essentially the structure implies that transitions between generations
are supresed with respect to transitions within the same generation, in a symmetric way. The most suppressed transitions are between
the first and third generations followed by the ones between the second and third and the least suppressed are between first and second.

\begin{equation}
  |V_{\text{CKM}}|
                   = \begin{pmatrix} \VudMag & \VusMag & \VubMag \\ \VcdMag & \VcsMag & \VcbMag \\ \VtdMag & \VtsMag & \VtbMag \end{pmatrix}
              \simeq \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0.2 & 0.008 \\ 0.2 & 1 & 0.04 \\ 0.008 & 0.04 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
      \label{CKMmatrix}
  \end{equation}

Testing the consistency of the CKM elements measurments is a central goal of flavour physics.
In order to achieve such tests it is usefull to define a paramterization of the CKM matrix.
By construction the CKM matrix has 3 real parameters and one compelx phase\footnote{After exploiting the unitarity of $V_{\rm CKM}$ and all the redundant quark field phases.}
The choise of the CKM matrix parametrazation is arbitrary. However due to the observed structure the so called {\it Wolfenstein}~\cite{Wolfenstein:1983yz,Buras-wolfenstein}
parametrization shown in \equref{CKMwolfenstein} is a standard parametrization. Where the three real parameters, $\lambda,A,\rho$
and the complex one $\eta$ can be seen.

\begin{equation}
  |V_{\text{CKM}}|
                   = \begin{pmatrix} \VudWolf & \VusWolf & \VubWolf \\
                                     \VcdWolf & \VcsWolf & \VcbWolf \\
                                     \VtdWolf & \VtsWolf & \VtbWolf \end{pmatrix} + \mathcal{O}(\lambda^4)
      \label{CKMwolfenstein}
\end{equation}

\noindent As it was previously mentioned the CKM matrix is a unitary matrix, meaning that $V_{\text{CKM}} V_{\text{CKM}}^\dagger = I_{3x3}$.
This leads to the so called unitarity and orthogonality relations. The last are sums of complex numbers that are equal to zero, thus can be
represented by triangles in the complex plane. There are six orthogonality releations two of which are relevant for the current thesis since
the CKM elements present in those relations govern the dynamics in the \Bs and \Bd meson systems. These two relations are shown in
\equref{unitConstraints}. The last equations are devidied by $\Vcd\Vcb^*$ for \Bd and $\Vcs\Vcb^*$ for \Bs and then illustrated in \figref{unitTriangles}.
Note that the CKM element $\Vts$ has a complex part at higher order in $\lambda$, see section 13.3 of ~\cite{PDG}.

\begin{subequations}
  \label{unitConstraints}
  \begin{align}
    \Bd : & \quad \Vud\Vub^* + \Vcd\Vcb^* + \Vtd\Vtb^* = 0
    \label{unitConstraints_Bd} \\
    \Bs : & \quad \Vus\Vub^* + \Vcs\Vcb^* + \Vts\Vtb^* = 0
    \label{unitConstraints_Bs}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

The coordinates of the apex in the two triangles are defined as $(\bar{\rho},\bar{\eta})$ and $(\bar{\rho}_s,\bar{\eta}_s)$ respectivelly for \figref{unitTriangles_bd} and
\figref{unitTriangles_bs}. Whreas by inspecting the triangles one can define the angles as shown in \equref{bdAnglesDef} and \equref{bsAnglesDef}.

\begin{equation}
  \label{bdAnglesDef}
  \alpha \equiv \arg\left( -\frac{\Vtd\Vtb^*}{\Vud\Vub^*} \right)
  \quad
  \beta  \equiv \arg\left( -\frac{\Vcd\Vcb^*}{\Vtd\Vtb^*} \right)
  \quad

\end{equation}

  %\quad
  %\gamma_s \equiv \arg\left( -\frac{\Vcs\Vcb^*}{\Vus\Vub^*} \right)
\end{equation}

There is no fundamental reason known in the Standard model for the observed hierarchy of the CKM elemetns.
One of the main goals of flavour physics is to check the consistency of the CKM picture.
Overlaying many measurements of flavour physics observables in the complex plane should show a consistent
picture, see \figref{unitarity_triangle}. For completnes it is intreasting to mention that in the lepton
sector a similar mixing matrix is active. The hierarchy there is completelly different which is yet another
intriguing detail of the Standard Model.


\subsubsection{CP-Violation and fermion masses}
It is intreasting to point out the common origin of CP-Violation and fermion masses in the Standard Model~\cite{KM-mechanism}.
From the one hand the CKM matrix which was introduced to couple the higgs to the fermions and thus give them mass.
On the other hand the fact that $V_{\rm CKM}$ is a complex valued matrix allows for CP-Violation in the
Standard Model by the weak intraction. This is because the charged current interaction of \equref{CClagrangianMass}
will be invariant under the CP operation only if $V_{\rm CKM}=V_{\rm CKM}^*$, which is not true.
