The main focus of the current thesis is to provide the required ingredients for a high precision measurement of
the weak phase \phis. The latter is an important parameter related to \CP violation, which, as explained throughout
the current chapter, is related to the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. Measuring \phis enables to look
for deviations from the established theory of elementary particles. Given the state of the art measurement of \phis \cite{phis-3fb-paper}
it became clear that in order to probe these potential deviations, \phis needs to be measured with high precision.
However, entering this high precision regime one finds out that there are other processes that need to be
controlled first. Otherwise a high precision measurement of \phis could not provide insight on the previous
deviations. Controlling these higher order processes is achieved by analyzing \BsJpsiKst decays recorded
by the \lhcb detector introduced in \chapref{lhcb_detector}. The current chapter places \phis into perspective
with respect to the established theory of particle physics. The analysis of the \BsJpsiKst decays that are
required to control the above mentioned higher order effects is presented in \chapref{Data_Analysis}.
The interpretation and impact of the analysis can be found in the last chapter \chapref{Penguins}.
Lastly, \chapref{Muon_id_hlt} is dedicated to a particular part of the \lhcb data acquisition system,
which is responsible for selecting a certain type of elementary particles called {\it muons}, see \tabref{quarksLeptons}.
