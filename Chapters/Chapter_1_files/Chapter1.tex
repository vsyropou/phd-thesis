% High energy physics is the field of physics that studies the interactions between elementary particles. The theoretical framework relevant to
% that field of physics is called \textit{Standard Model} of Particle Physics. So far this model has been very successful in describing the experimental
% observations of the high energy physics experiments. However, due to several hints for Physics beyond the \textit{Standard Model}, further testing of
% it is necesarry. This is the reason that lead scientists to build more powerful accelerators, with the most recent one being the \textit{Large Hadron Collider}
% (LHC) at CERN. More powerful machines enables testing of the model at a new energy scale where the model makes certain predictions and it is up to the experiment
%  to confirm or falsify those predictions. LHC is an outstanding combination of accelerator and detector machines designed to explore the experimentally unknown energy
%  region of up to $\sqrt{s}=14 \;\text {TeV}$. Out of the four major detectors at CERN, LHCb is the one designed to study CP-Violation, a puzzling phenomenon
%  responsible for the difference between matter and antimatter. LHCb's strategy to accomplish that is based on the detection of $B$ mesons and their final decay
%  particles, from a primary \textit{proton-proton} collision.
