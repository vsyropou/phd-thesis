% High energy physics is the field of physics that studies the interactions between elementary particles. The theoretical framework relevant to
% that field of physics is called \textit{Standard Model} of Particle Physics. So far this model has been very successful in describing the experimental
% observations of the high energy physics experiments. However, due to several hints for Physics beyond the \textit{Standard Model}, further testing of
% it is necesarry. This is the reason that lead scientists to build more powerful accelerators, with the most recent one being the \textit{Large Hadron Collider}
% (LHC) at CERN. More powerful machines enables testing of the model at a new energy scale where the model makes certain predictions and it is up to the experiment
%  to confirm or falsify those predictions. LHC is an outstanding combination of accelerator and detector machines designed to explore the experimentally unknown energy
%  region of up to $\sqrt{s}=14 \;\text {TeV}$. Out of the four major detectors at CERN, LHCb is the one designed to study CP-Violation, a puzzling phenomenon
%  responsible for the difference between matter and antimatter. LHCb's strategy to accomplish that is based on the detection of $B$ mesons and their final decay
%  particles, from a primary \textit{proton-proton} collision.

\section{Flavour Physics}
\label{Flavour_Physics}
As it was mentioned in \secref{The_Standard_Model} quarks and leptons acquire mass through the Yukawa term
of the Standard Model lagrangian. An important aspect of the weak interaction, emerges from this term,
namelly the quark field mixing. The last effectivelly allows for transitions of quarks between the three generations.
A brief description of the quark mixing and its relevance to CP-Violation is given in what follows. The section
concludes with a brief status overview of the {\it flavour physics}, which as it was implied in \secref{The_Standard_Model}
is the part of Standard Model responsible for up-down quark type transitions.

% As it was mentioned in \secref{The_Standard_Model} quark fields aquire mass in the yuakawa
% term of the Standard Model lagrangian after the so called {\it spontaneus symmetry breaking}[ref] which is done by the
% higgs mechanism[ref]\footnote{In the higgs mechanism the higgs potential in \equref{lagrangian}
% is chosen such that its lowest value, the so called {\it vacum expectation value}, breaks the symmetry of the lagranian.}.
% After that step the yakawa
% term\footnote{Ommiting quark higgs field interaction terms.}
% for the quark fields takes the form shown in \equref{yukawa_flavour}.

\begin{equation}
  % -\mathscr{L}_{\text{Yukawa}} = M_{ij}^d \bar{d_{Li}} d_{Rj} + M_{ij}^u \bar{u_{Li}} u_{Rj} + h.c.,
  -\mathscr{L}_{\text{Yukawa}} = \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ y_{ij}^d \bar{d_{Li}} d_{Rj} + y_{ij}^u \bar{u_{Li}} u_{Rj} \right] + h.c.,
  \label{yukawa_flavour}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $v$ is the higgs vacum expectation value and $y$

After that quark fields are expressed in the flavor
space\footnote{As explaine din \secref{The_Standard_Model} there are 6 quarck quantum numbers - flavours. The basis
consisting of quarck flavours is usually called falvour space.}.
The flavour eigen states of that space are not the same as the mass eigenstates. Thus is order to obtain
meaningfull masses, the quark fields must be rotated such that they are diagonal in mass space.
The last results in quark fields with well defined mass and a mix (supperposition) of falvour quantum numbers.

The matrix that performs the rotaion of the quarck fiedls from the flavour to the mass eigenstates is the
well known {\it CKM} matrix shown in \equref{}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Yukawa couplings.
  \item Quark mixing
  \item CKM picture
  \item The falvour physics observables, puzzle fasi, hits for Np, We need everything.
