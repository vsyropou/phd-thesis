\label{Introduction}

The main focus of the current thesis is to provide the required ingredients for a high precision measurement of
the weak phase \phis. The latter is an important parameter related to \CP-violation, which, as explained throughout
the current chapter, is related to the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. Measuring \phis enables to look
for deviations from the established theory of elementary particles. Given the state of the art measurement of \phis
it became clear that in order to probe these potential deviations, \phis needs to be measured with high precision.
However, entering this high level regime one finds out that there are other higher order processes that need to be
controlled. Otherwise a high precision measurement of \phis could not provide insight on deviations from the
established theory. Controlling these higher order processes is achieved by analyzing \BsJpsiKst decays recorded
by the \lhcb experiment, see \chapref{lhcb_detector}.

The current chapter places the \phis parameter into perspective with respect to the established theory of particle
physics. The analysis of the \BsJpsiKst decays that are required to control the above mentioned higher order effects
is performed in \chapref{Data_Analysis}. The interpretation and impact can be found in the last chapter \chapref{Penguins}.
Lastly, \chapref{Muon_id_hlt} is dedicated to a particular part of the \lhcb data acquisition system, which is responsible for
selecting a certain type of elementary particles called {\it muons}, see \tabref{quarksLeptons}.
