In this section I describe blah blah and blah.
CP-Violation in the Standard Model manifests only when the weak interaction is involved.

\subsubsection{The $\BBbarSyst$ system}
The \Bs meson\footnote{Mesons are bound states of quark antiquark pair.} is an electrically neutral
particle consisting of a \bquarkbar and a \squark quarks. An important feature of the \Bs meson,
and all neutral mesons, is that it can spontaneously change into its antiparticle, the \Bsb meson.
This feature is called {\it neutral meson oscilations} and it is posibe in the Standard Model via
the so called {\it box diagram}, see \figref{bs_box}. Meson oscilations


\subsubsection{The \phis parameter and NP}

\subsubsection{The \phis measuremnt}




\begin{itemize}
  \item Effective hamiltonian for $\BBbarSyst$ (mass and cp eigenstates)
  \item Clasification of cpv effects
  \item What is \phis
  \item \phis status
  \item NP in \phis
\end{itemize}
