The \Bs meson is an electrically neutral particle that consists of two quarks, specifically (\bquarkbar\squark).
The two quarks in the mesons are bound by the strong interaction. An important feature of
the \Bs meson, and all heavy neutral mesons, is that it can spontaneously change into its antiparticle,
the \Bsb meson and \viceversa. This feature is called {\it meson oscillations} and it is possible
in the Standard Model via so called {\it box diagram} of \figref{bs_box}.
Meson oscillations play a central role in flavor physics. Particularly because they are sensitive to the
existence of new particles as will be explained in \secref{probe_new_phys}. CP-Violating effects can
appear in \BBbarSyst oscillations, in the subsequent decay and in the interference between oscillation
and decay. The current section as well as \secref{WeakPhase} qualitatively addresses the way that
these effects manifest themselves.

\subsubsection{The \BBbarSyst System}
\label{the_bbar_system}

The oscillating behaviour of the \Bs and \Bsb mesons invites a phenomenological approach
where the two mesons are treated as a coupled quantum mechanical system. This approach
is based on\cite{Weisskopf:1930au,Weisskopf:1930ps} and uses an {\it effective Hamiltonian}\cite{eff-hamiltonian-bs-syst,DeBruyn-thesis}
to describe the time evolution of the \Bs or \Bsb meson. The wave-functions of the mesons
are defined as:

\begin{equation}
  \centering
  \ket{\Bs}  \equiv  \ket{\bquarkbar\squark}, \;\;\; \ket{\Bsb} \equiv  \ket{\bquark\squarkbar},
  \label{bs_wavefunctions}
\end{equation}

\noindent implying that the states \Bs and \Bsb have a definite quark content, or in other words,
they are flavour eigenstates. The effective Hamiltonian, $H_{\rm eff}$ is a 2x2 non-diagonal non-Hermitian matrix.
The non-diagonal feature is due to the oscillating nature of the \BBbarSyst system whereas the non
Hermitian description takes into account the probability that the system will eventually decay to some final state.
By diagonalizing the effective Hamiltonian one can obtain the mass eigenstates, \ket{\Bs{}_{,H}}, \ket{\Bs{}_{,L}},
of the system, shown in \equref{bs_mass_eigen}.

\begin{align}
  \centering
  \ket{\Bs{}_{,H}} &= p \ket{\Bs} + q \ket{\Bsb}, \nonumber \\
  \ket{\Bs{}_{,L}} &= p \ket{\Bs} - q \ket{\Bsb}.
  \label{bs_mass_eigen}
\end{align}

More details on the exact calculations can be found in section 13.1 of\cite{PDG} and in \cite{jeroenThesis,DeBruyn-thesis}.

The amount of mixing between the mass and flavour eigenstates is governed by the complex parameters $p,q$.
Theoretical calculations \cite{Lenz:2011ti} and experimental measurement \cite{asl-paper} point to the ratio
\qoverp being compatible with one\footnote{Some tensions between theory and experiment are still to be resolved in the future.
Tensions are mainly from a measurement \cite{Abazov:2013uma} of the \dzero collaboration.}.
In addition the difference in mass and lifetime between the two mass eigenstates are important observables of the
\BBbarSyst system and are denoted as $\Delta m_s$ and $\Delta\Gamma_s$ respectively.

\subsubsection{Types of CP-Violation}
The ratio $|\qoverp|$ is related to a type of CP-Violation. Specifically the CP-Violation {\it in the mixing} (of the \BBbarSyst system).
The relation is shown in the asymmetry of \equref{acp_mixing}.

\begin{equation}
  \centering
  a_{\rm sl}^{s}  \equiv \frac{\bra{\Bsb}\ket{\Bs} - \bra{\Bs}\ket{\Bsb}} {\bra{\Bsb}\ket{\Bs} + \bra{\Bs}\ket{\Bsb}}
                       = \frac{1 - \left|\nicefrac{q}{p}\right|^4}{1 + \left|\nicefrac{p}{q}\right|^4},
  \label{acp_mixing}
\end{equation}

\noindent where it can be seen that $a_{\rm sl}^{s}$ vanishes if $|\qoverp|= 1$. The subscript $sl$ stands for a {\it semileptonic}
final state, that is typically used to measure this type of asymmetries in the neutral mesons. A semileptonic final state
consists of mesons and leptons. From the lepton sign it can be inferred whether the original neutral meson oscillated or not.

Another type of CP-Violation, the so called {\it in the decay} or {\it direct} CP violation, is based on the
amplitude, $A_f$, of a certain meson decay to some final state $f$.
Using the CP conjugated $\bar{A}_{\bar{f}}$ amplitude the asymmetry of \equref{cpv_decay} can be constructed.
This asymmetry vanishes in case $|\nicefrac{\bar{A}_{\bar{f}}}{A_f}| = 1$.

\begin{equation}
  \centering
  \Acp{\text{dir}} = \frac{\Gamma(\Bs \rightarrow f) - \Gamma(\Bsb \rightarrow \bar{f})} {\Gamma(\Bs \rightarrow f) + \Gamma(\Bsb \rightarrow \bar{f})}
                   = \frac{ |\nicefrac{\bar{A}_{\bar{f}}}{A_f}|^2 - 1}{|\nicefrac{\bar{A}_{\bar{f}}}{A_f}|^2 + 1}.
\label{cpv_decay}
\end{equation}

Finally there is one more type of CP Violation and that is in the {\it interference} between
a neutral meson decaying directly to a final state $f$ or oscillating to its antiparticle and then decaying
to the same final state $f$. Due to its relevance to the current thesis, this type of CP-Violation is explained
in more detail in the next section. All the above classifications are based on section 13.1.4 of\cite{PDG}.
