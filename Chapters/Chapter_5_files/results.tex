The results of the \chisq fit described in \secref{penguin_more_chanells} are shown in \equref{peng_a_theta_results}.

\begin{subequations}
\label{peng_a_theta_results}
\begin{align}
    \aPeng{0}         & = 0.01^{+0.10}_{-0.01} & \thPeng{0}         & = -\parenthesis{82^{+262}_{-97}}^\circ & \hadRatio{0}{}{\prime}         = 1.212^{+0.075}_{-0.057},\\
    \aPeng{\parallel} & = 0.07^{+0.11}_{-0.05} & \thPeng{\parallel} & = -\parenthesis{84^{+93}_{-129}}^\circ  & \hadRatio{\parallel}{}{\prime} = 1.230^{+0.102}_{-0.078},\\
    \aPeng{\perp}     & = 0.05^{+0.12}_{-0.05} & \thPeng{\perp}     & = +\parenthesis{53^{+127}_{-232}}^\circ & \hadRatio{\perp}{}{\prime}     = 1.038^{+0.083}_{-0.065}.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\noindent The quoted uncertainties are the quadratic sum of statistical and systematic ones.
The results of the parameters $(\akPeng,\thkPeng)$ can be visualized better in the contours of
Figs \ref{pengPlot_long}, \ref{pengPlot_perp} and \ref{pengPlot_para}. Note that the $\Hobs{k}$
observables have almost no effect on the result due to their associated large uncertainty.
Also note that the $\Hobs{k}$ observables are in tension with respect to the central value of
the fit result. This suggests probably that the assumption \equref{had_ratios_assuption} probably
not true.

The best fit estimates of \equref{peng_a_theta_results} are subsequently translated, using \equref{tandelta},
to the final estimate of the phase shift $\DeltaPhisJpsiPhi{k}$, due to penguin topologies:

\begin{subequations}
\label{delta_phis_result}
\begin{align}   
\DeltaPhisJpsiPhi{0}         & = 0.000 \; ^{+0.009}_{-0.011} \; {\rm (stat)} \; ^{+0.006}_{-0.007} \; ({\rm syst}) = 0.000 \; ^{+0.010}_{-0.014},\\
\DeltaPhisJpsiPhi{\parallel} & = 0.001 \; ^{+0.010}_{-0.014} \; {\rm (stat)} \; ^{+0.006}_{-0.007} \; ({\rm syst)} = 0.001 \; ^{+0.012}_{-0.016},\\
\DeltaPhisJpsiPhi{\perp}     & = 0.003 \; ^{+0.010}_{-0.014} \; {\rm (stat)} \; ^{+0.006}_{-0.007} \; ({\rm syst)} = 0.003 \; ^{+0.012}_{-0.016},
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\noindent where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic and due to the hadronic parameters respectivelly. 
{\color{red} Comment on the uncertainties, }
The systematic uncertainty to $\DeltaPhis{k}$ is assigned by assuming $20\%$ $\grpsuthree_F$ breaking,
according to what was mentioned at the end of \secref{had_pars_suthree}, by performing a special fit 
explained in \secref{su3_breaking}.

Note that the penguin parameters $(\akPeng,\thkPeng)$ are ratios of hadronic amplitudes. Given that it is
interesting to point out that any factorizable $\grpsuthree_F$ breaking effects entering through the assumption
of \equref{su3_apply} cancel out.
Thus the results reported here suffer from non factorizable $\grpsuthree_F$ breaking which are small,
according to \cite{DeBruyn-thesis}. The previous statement is supported by the values of the fitted hadronic parameter
ratios which are close to the once calculated assuming factorization holds. As it is mentioned in \cite{DeBruyn-thesis},
either the non factorization $\grpsuthree_F$ effects or their ratio with respect to the factorizable $\grpsuthree_F$
ones are small.

% \Re[a_0] & = \phantom{-}0.01_{-0.32}^{+0.97}\:, & \Im[a_0] & = \phantom{-}0.025_{-0.031}^{+0.035}\:, & \chi^2_{\text{min}} & = 1.1 \times 10^{-7}\:,\label{Eq:Pen_Re_Im_Long}\\

% \Re[a_\parallel] & = \phantom{-}0.31_{-0.51}^{+0.58}\:, & \Im[a_\parallel] & = -0.082_{-0.087}^{+0.074}\:,& \chi^2_{\text{min}} & = 1.2 \times 10^{-3}\:,\label{Eq:Pen_Re_Im_Para}\\
% %
% \Re[a_\perp] & = -0.44_{-0.21}^{+0.27}\:, & \Im[a_\perp] & = \phantom{-}0.037_{-0.076}^{+0.079}\:,& \chi^2_{\text{min}} & = 1.5 \times 10^{-6}\:,\label{Eq:Pen_Re_Im_Perp}
% \end{align}

Lastly the penguin shifts $\DeltaPhisJpsiPhi{k}$ quoted in \equref{delta_phis_result}
suggest that they contributions of penguin topologies to the \BsJpsiPhi decay amplitude are small ($<1^\circ$).
{\color{red} Maybe add some comments on future prospect, in view of the increased precision.}

\subsection{Further Crosschecks}
There are two important issues that the fitting strategy as described in \secref{penguin_chi2_fit}
does not take into account. Namely, $\grpsuthree_F$ breaking effects and correlations, from the
experimental measurement, between the observables \equref{chisq_form_with}. Both of these issues
addressed in the current section.

\subsubsection{\grpsuthree breaking}
\label{su3_breaking}
Potential $\grpsuthree_F$ effects manifest themselves in the calculations of the hadronic parameters ratios
when computing the $\Hobs{k}$ observable and in the assumption of \equref{su3_apply}. However, due to the
followed strategy the hadronic parameter ratios are not affected by $\grpsuthree_F$ breaking since the are fitted for.
As far as the assumption of \equref{su3_apply} is concerned, a special fit is performed using only observables
related to \BdJpsiRho channel, to investigate the effect of $\grpsuthree_F$. For that, $(\akPeng,\thkPeng)$
are re-expressed as shown in \equref{su3_breaking_invoke}

\begin{figure}[!t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[trim=0.0cm 0.0cm 0.0cm 0.0cm, clip=true,scale=0.4]{Figures/Chapter5/Penguin_Contribution_Re_vs_Im_allB2VV_Perp_withH.pdf}
  \caption{Limits on the penguin parameters for: $\aPeng{\perp}$ and $\thPeng{\perp}$.}
  \label{pengPlot_perp}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
  \centering
  \akPeng \to \xi_k \; \akPeng'' \quad \thkPeng \to \delta_k + \thkPeng''.
\label{su3_breaking_invoke}
\end{equation}

\noindent The quantities $\xi_k$ and $\delta_k$ are allowed to vary in the fit and can thus absorb
potential $\grpsuthree_F$ effects that will break the assumption of \equref{su3_apply}.
The central values of $\xi_k$ and $\delta_k$ assume perfect $\grpsuthree_F$ symmetry, meaning $\xi_k=1$ and $\delta_k=0$.
However, a Gaussian constrain allows them to vary within a range of up to $50\%$
$\grpsuthree_F$\footnote{Meaning $\sigma{\xi_k}\in\brackets{0,0.5}$ and $\sigma_{\delta_k}\in\brackets{0,40}^\circ$ }.
Repeating the above-mentioned special fit showed that the value of $\DeltaPhis{k}$
does not depend on the amount of allowed $\grpsuthree_F$ symmetry breaking.
This is most likely due to the particular structure of \equref{tandelta}, meaning that
the value of $\akPeng$, or $\xi_k$ in that case, becomes less pronounced by values of
$\thkPeng$ which are close to $90^\circ$.

\subsubsection{Correlations of polarization states}
Correlations between the $k$ polarizations of the observables entering the \chisq fit are ignored in the
current analysis. These correlations enter mainly via the $\Acp{k}$ and $\fP{k}$. For example, see the
correlation matrix \tabref{correlation_matrix} of the angular analysis performed in \chapref{Data_Analysis}.
In order to check the effect of these correlations on the estimation of the penguin parameters $(\akPeng,\thkPeng)$,
an additional \chisq fit is performed. In that fit the correlations are indeed taken into account.
The results show a small increase on the uncertainty of the penguin parameter $\thPeng{0}$.
This result suggest that the impact of the correlations on the parameters of interest is negligible.
