\chapter{Data Analysis}
\label{Data_Analysis}

The parameters of interest as described in \chapref{Introduction} are extracted from the analysis of \runone
\lhcb data accumulated over the years 2011 and 2012, which correspond to a total integrated luminosity
of 3\invfb. Before any such attempt the data as they come straight from the detector need to be filterd
to reduce the presence of background events.

\secref{Event_Selection} describes all the steps involded to reduce background in the data. For this purpose
it is necessary to model the invariant mass distribution of the \BJpsiKpi decay chanells, which is addressed
in \secref{The_Invariant_Mass_Distribution}. In \secref{Angular_Analysis} the details of estimating the parameters
of intrest are presented in steps.

% Expected signal yield
% The center of mass energy was 3 and 4 \tev respectivelly for 2011 and 2012.

\section{Event Selection}
\label{Event_Selection}

There are three stages of event selection necessary to extract the signal. First a multivariate clasifier

In this section we present the real data samples (\secref{realData}) and simulated data samples (\secref{MCsamples})
used, and the stripping and offline selection (\secref{secStrip}). We reconstruct the $\jpsi$ into $\mu^+\mu^-$ and the $\bar{K}^{*0}$ into $K^-\pi^+$, as well as their charge conjugated decays. A very large \BdJKst component is 
present in the data and taken into account in the analysis, also used as normalisation channel as well 
(see \secref{sec:norm_JpsiBdKst}). The selection done at the stripping level is ``cut-based'', while the one done 
offline uses boosted decision trees with gradient boosting (BDTG).
