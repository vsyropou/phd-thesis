Thinks I have to remember or be sure about:
-What is gradient boosting.
-Choice of bdtg input variables. Why those variables
-Why do you not reweight the muons pt in the iterative procedure.
-How are the erros of the efficiency moments caculated.
-Make sure you understand the models used in the Kpi mas dependence
-Why the oscilation damping parameter kappa in the production assymetry looks the way it does 
-Why no systematic in the detection assymetry.
-When is a matrix invertible
-Have a genral idea on the transversity framework
-Understand the convension on the signs of production and detection assymetry.
-Why is the efficiency ratio between jpsiphi and jpsikst around two.
-Make sure you know what the p value and chi2 probability is.
-Check which of the two BrFractions are used in the normalization (jpsiPhi or JpsiKst maybe both. averaged).
-Make sure you know how the luminosity of the mc is scaled to the one of the data.
-nll scans: 
    In deltaS1 and deltaS4 the correspondint fS hits upper and lower boundaries.
    In f0 lo stats spiekes. Not there with Bd. 
-toys:
    mkpi bin phase and fraction are fine. the gaussian is choped because fS3 is close to a physical boundary. A gaussian pull is not appropriate.
-Acceptance is at the 2 sigma level the same between bs and bd

To Do (not urgent):
-- Update Jeroen's thesis reference once it is ready.
-- Polish references layout.
-- hunt references like [??]
-- Uniform table format
-- Fix range of mass fit tables.
-- Full stops in footnotes



To Do (kind of urgent)
-- Check if your toys make sence (varius values of acp. How to assign a systematic)
-- Add text to Selection: BDTG was trained with representative data. Bdtg was tested for overtraining
-- Add text: Selection: Mention that mass fit has been checked with toys.
-- Fix axis title names in 2d efficiency histograms.
