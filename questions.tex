Thinks I have to remember or be sure about:
-Why do you not reweight the muons pt in the iterative procedure.
-How are the erros of the efficiency moments caculated.
-Make sure you understand the models used in the Kpi mas dependence
-Why the oscilation damping parameter kappa in the production assymetry looks the way it does
-Why no systematic in the detection asymmetry.
-When is a matrix invertible
-Have a genral idea on the transversity framework
-Understand the convension on the signs of production and detection assymetry.
-Why is the efficiency ratio between jpsiphi and jpsikst around two.
-Make sure you know what the p value and chi2 probability is.
-Make sure you know how the luminosity of the mc is scaled to the one of the data.
-nll scans:
    In deltaS1 and deltaS4 the correspondint fS hits upper and lower boundaries.
    In f0 lo stats spiekes. Not there with Bd.
-toys:
    mkpi bin phase and fraction are fine. the gaussian is choped because fS3 is close to a physical boundary. A gaussian pull is not appropriate.
-Acceptance is at the 2 sigma level the same between bs and bd
- Understan why your ang acc systematic is smaller than in the offcial analysis.
- Make sure you knwo what CLT is about.
- Make sure you understand the systematics table of the Br measurement

- What is a left/right handed spinor. How dows handedness relates to the V-A nature of the weak interaction
- Why Yuakawa is of the type u_L d_R whereas the CC u_L u_L
- Check all the formulas in the theoretical introduction.
- Why not overconstrain CKM elements in the A,lamda plane?? (cpv does not manifest there.)
- Why wolfenstein is an approximate parametreization.
- Why do we diagonalize the mass matrix in the yukawa couplings.
- The falvour eighestets interact with the materals of the detector?? Noooo
  It is EM responsible for energy loss and decay. (Now what happens with decays in flight.? Like one meson to another)
- Does off-shell mean that the particle exists within heisenberg's uncertainty.??
- Why arent we use the Acp mix and dir form jpsiphi in the penguin fit??
- Why not a use A delta gamma in the penguin fit (maybe it offers little info in the fit)
- Readundant quark phases in the number of ckm parameters.
- The high uncertainty in hadronic parameters is because you ignore correlations between the hadronic forma factors, ncesessary to buuild A/A
- Color supression  explained in krystof page 20
- Low energy effective hamiltonian for B mesons are analogous to the fermi dewcay, which is a 4 point interaction. The W is highly virtual because of the b mass.
- What is facrtorization. What is being factorized )Krystof page 26 (For me it means that quarks seperate before they interact with eachother with gluons)
- Why the hadronic facrtors do not enter the acp mix and acp dir observables.
- What exactly does the wmega-phi mixing affects.(which obesrvables or does the amplitude structure change.??)  maybe check in  {Faller:2008gt}
- more su 3 breakig in hep-ph/9504326
- Be sure of what you write in hadronic paramters section.
- Why C is not Acpmix according to theory.
- Why the sWeights change the likelihood shape. And why, intuitivelly, the errros are underestiamted.
- Why do we quote only statistical uncertainty in the detection assymetry.
-- Make sure you understand the chiw probability in the eff moments tables.

Alltime checks:
-- Make sure systematics table is up to date
-- Uniform table and figure format
-- Comas in equations
-- Full stops in footnotes
-- Begin centering to all equations

To Do (general).
-- Force paper size b5
-- cmky mauro an eiani mauro.
-- replace CP with \CP, or not
-- Polish references layout.
-- Why one group of toys is bad.
-- Gerhahrd comment on luminosity in the peaking background section ???? forgot what this is about!!!!!!!.
-- Make sure that words do not wxceed margins

To do for second draft.
-- Read nicelly and folllow the citations and references to see if they make sence-- check for dead references to equations [??]
-- Capitalize initial leters of words in sections and subsections
-- Explain variables in the selection table of the appendix
-- Make tex plots of the constrianed acceptance plots of chapter 4
-- Ref for BDTG
-- Efficiency drop in costhetaK
-- likelihood function in analysis chapter is wrooongg??? maybe
-- Capitalie l in lagrangian
-- Capitalize h in higgs
-- Adjust plots, tables, etc to the new paper size
-- Something is fucked up with the margins pages seem to not have the same lenght
-- Caption in tables up or down, do the same for the figures
-- Maybe reduce font size of some tables
-- withs, after equations go out of the equation environment
-- blank pages between chapters???
