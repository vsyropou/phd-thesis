-- Why is the itnerference stronger in Bs wrt to the Bd
   Ans: More swave....
-- How did you make th bdt plot
   Ans: Approximat eplot. Matched peaks. No conclusion is taken from thatThis is why you cannot see the black points.
-- What is the hierarchy problem
   Ans: Huge higher order corrections on top of a small higgs mass.
-- Why CKM rotates only the down type quarks
   Ans: Simply it is not needed
-- Readundant quark phases in the number of ckm parameters. How does field phases work, why can u remove them
   Ans: One Euler angle for each family. Relative phases matter only.
-- Why not a use A delta gamma in the penguin fit
   Ans: Maybe it offers little info in the fit due to small DetaGamma_s. I trust Faler and Robert.
-- su3 breaking factor delta, why the phase from 0 to 40 and not.
   Ans: I trust Krystof and Robert. Faller algebreic structure of the observabes is such that 40 degrees is enough. I tried more and it was good enough.
-- What exactly does the wmega-phi mixing affects.(which obesrvables or does the amplitude structure change.??)
   Ans: Good apprximation according to Faller. I am not a theoritician.
