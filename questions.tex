What is gradient boosting.
Choice of bdtg input variables.
Why do you not reweight the muons pt in the iterative procedure.
How are the erros of the efficiency moments caculated. 
Comment on the values of the efficiency moments
Make sure you understand the models used in the Kpi mas dependence
Why the oscilation damping parameter kappa in the production assymetry looks the way it does 
Why no systematic in the detection assymetry.
When is a matrix invertible
Argue in favour of the iterative procedure. Why are you really doing that.
What is the chi^2 probability
Why is the distribution of the expected number of events follows a poison distribution.
What are generator levele efficiencies
Have a genral idea on the transversity framework
Understand what the convension on the signs of production and detection assymetry.
Why is the efficiency ration between jpsiphi and jpsikst around two.
Make sure you know what the p value and chi2 probability is.
Check if your toys make sence
Check which of the two BrFractions are used in the normalization (jpsiPhi or JpsiKst).
Make sure you know how the luminosity o fthe mc is scaled to the one of the data.

To Do:
-- Update Jeroen's thsis reference once it is ready.
-- Polish references layout.
-- hunt references like [??]
-- Uniform table format
-- Known angular resolution. How??
-- Selction: BDTG was trained with representative data. Bdtg was tested for overtraining.
-- Fix range of mass fit tables.
-- Mention that mass fit has been checked with toys.
-- Full stops in footnotes
-- Mention that It has been checked tha tthe acceptance is at the 2 sigma level the same between bs and bd
