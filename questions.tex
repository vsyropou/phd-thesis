Thinks I have to remember or be sure about:
-Why do you not reweight the muons pt in the iterative procedure.
-How are the erros of the efficiency moments caculated.
-Make sure you understand the models used in the Kpi mas dependence
-Why the oscilation damping parameter kappa in the production assymetry looks the way it does
-Why no systematic in the detection assymetry.
-When is a matrix invertible
-Have a genral idea on the transversity framework
-Understand the convension on the signs of production and detection assymetry.
-Why is the efficiency ratio between jpsiphi and jpsikst around two.
-Make sure you know what the p value and chi2 probability is.
-Make sure you know how the luminosity of the mc is scaled to the one of the data.
-nll scans:
    In deltaS1 and deltaS4 the correspondint fS hits upper and lower boundaries.
    In f0 lo stats spiekes. Not there with Bd.
-toys:
    mkpi bin phase and fraction are fine. the gaussian is choped because fS3 is close to a physical boundary. A gaussian pull is not appropriate.
-Acceptance is at the 2 sigma level the same between bs and bd
- Understan why your ang acc systematic is smaller than in the offcial analysis.
- Make sure you knwo what CLT is about.
- Make sure you understand the systematics table of the Br measurement

- What is a left/right handed spinor. How dows handedness relates to the V-A nature of the weak interaction
- Why Yuakawa is of the type u_L d_R whereas the CC u_L u_L
- Check all the formulas in the theoretical introduction.
- Why not overconstrain CKM elements in the A,lamda plane?? (cpv does not manifest there.)
- Why wolfenstein is an approximate parametreization.
- Why do we diagonalize the mass matrix in the yukawa couplings.
- The falvour eighestets interact with the materals of the detector?? Noooo
  It is EM responsible for energy loss and decay. (Now what happens with decays in flight.? Like one meson to another)
- Does off-shell mean that the particle exists within heisenberg's uncertainty.??
- Why arent we use the Acp mix and dir form jpsiphi in the penguin fit??
- Why not a use A delta gamma in the penguin fit (maybe it offers little info in the fit)
- Readundant quark phases in the number of ckm parameters.

Alltime checks:
-- Make sure systematics table is up to date
-- Uniform table and figure format
-- Comas in equations
-- Full stops in footnotes
-- Begin centering to all equations

To Do (kind of urgent).
-- replace CP with \CP
-- Polish references layout.
-- Why one group of toys is bad
-- Gerhahrd comment on luminosity in the peaking background section.
-- Explain variables in the selection table of the appendix
-- Make tex plots of the constrianed acceptance plots of chapter 4
-- Capitalize initial leters of words in sections and subsections
